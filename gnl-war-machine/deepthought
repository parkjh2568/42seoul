+$
+$
+IT was two hours after the muezzin had called to evening prayer, and$
+night had canopied Tangier with a million stars. In the little Sok, the$
+bread-sellers sat cross-legged behind their wares, their candles burning$
+steadily, for there was not so much as the whisper of a wind blowing.$
+The monotonous strumming of a guitar from a Moorish caf√©, the agonised$
+_barlak!_ of a belated donkey-driver bringing his charge down the steep$
+streets which lead to the big bazaar, the shuffle of bare feet on$
+Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys cobbles, and the distant hush-hush of the rollers breaking$
+upon the amber shore‚M-^@M-^Tthese were the only sounds which the night held.$
+$
+John Maxell sat outside the Continental Caf√©, in the condition of bodily$
+content which a good dinner induces. Mental content should have$
+accompanied such a condition, but even the memory of a perfect dinner$
+could not wholly obliterate a certain uneasiness of mind. He had been$
+uneasy when he came to Tangier, and his journey through France and Spain$
+had been accompanied by certain apprehensions and doubts which$
+Cartwright had by no means dispelled.$
+$
+Rather, by his jovial evasions, his cheery optimism, and at times his$
+little irritable outbreaks of temper, he had given the eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Counsel further cause for disquiet.$
+$
+Cartwright sat at the other side of the table, and was unusually quiet.$
+This was a circumstance which was by no means displeasing to Maxell, for$
+the night was not conducive to talk. There are in Northern Africa many$
+nights like this, when one wishes to sit in dead silence and let thought$
+take its own course, unchecked and untrammelled. In Morocco such nights$
+are common and, anyway, Maxell had always found it difficult to discuss$
+business matters after dinner.$
+$
+Cartwright had no temperament and his quiet was due to other causes. It$
+was he who broke the silence, knocking out his pipe on the iron-topped$
+table with a clang which jarred his more sensitive companion to the very$
+spine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd stake my life and my soul on there being a reef,‚M-^@M-^] he said with a$
+suddenness which was almost as jarring. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, you‚M-^@M-^Yve seen the outcrop$
+for yourself, and isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it exactly the same formation as you see on the$
+Rand?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell nodded.$
+$
+Though a common-law man, he had been associated in mining cases and had$
+made a very careful study of the whole problem of gold extraction.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It looks right enough to me,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but as against that we have the$
+fact that some clever engineers have spent a great deal of time and$
+money trying to locate the reef. That there is gold in Morocco everybody$
+knows, and I should say, Cartwright, that you are right. But where is$
+the reef? It would cost a fortune to bore, even though we had the other$
+borings to guide us.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other made an impatient noise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if the reef were all mapped out it would be a simple matter,$
+but then we shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt get on to it, as we are to-day, at the cost of a$
+few thousands. Hang it all, Maxell, we‚M-^@M-^Yve got to take a certain amount$
+of risk! I know it‚M-^@M-^Ys a gamble quite as well as you. There‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+arguing that point with me. But other things are gambles too. Law was a$
+gamble to you for many years, and a bigger gamble after you took silk.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was a sore point with Maxell, as the other knew. A prosperous$
+junior, he had been called within the Bar, and taken upon himself the$
+function and style of King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsellor in the hope that his prosperity$
+would still further be expanded. And, like so many other men, he had$
+discovered that the successful junior is not necessarily the successful$
+K.C.$
+$
+Fortunately for him, he had long before contested and won a seat in$
+Parliament, and his service to the Government of the day had to some$
+extent ensured his future. But, financially, he had suffered$
+considerably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\silk isn‚M-^@M-^Yt any great catch to a man, I agree; and it was$
+certainly a gamble, and a losing gamble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Which reminds me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there was a talk, before I left$
+London, that you would be given Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is extremely unlikely,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Anyway, if they make me$
+Solicitor-General, that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt carry Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It carries a lot of money,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright after a pause for a moment,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and it‚M-^@M-^Ys money that counts just now, Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the lawyer nodded.$
+$
+He might have added that, but for the need for money, he would long$
+since have dropped his association with Alfred Cartwright, though$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood very high in certain circles of the City of$
+London. They had been at school together, though in that period there$
+had been no very great friendship between them. And Cartwright was$
+marked out for success from the beginning. He inherited a considerable$
+business when his father died, and he enlarged and improved upon it. He$
+had taken up a hundred and one outside interests, and had made most of$
+them pay. A few of them did not pay, and it was whispered that the$
+losses upon his failures took a considerable slice of the balance that$
+accrued from his successes.$
+$
+They had met again when Maxell was a junior and Cartwright the defendant$
+in a case which, had he lost, would have made him some thirty thousand$
+pounds the poorer. When Maxell thought back upon that event, he had to$
+confess that it was not a pleasant case, being one in which Cartwright$
+had been charged with something which was tantamount to$
+misrepresentation; and, although he had won, and won brilliantly, he had$
+never felt any great pride in his achievement.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said (the pauses were frequent and long), ‚M-^@M-^\I should hardly$
+imagine that the Prime Minister loves me to that extent. In Parliament$
+you have to be an uncomfortable quantity to be really successful. You$
+must be strong enough to have a national following, and sufficiently$
+independent to keep the Whips guessing. I am known as a safe man, and I$
+hold a safe seat, which I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose if I tried. That doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt make$
+for promotion. Of course, I could have had an Under-Secretaryship for$
+the asking, and that means a couple of thousand a year, but it also$
+means that you last out the life of the administration in a subordinate$
+capacity, and that, by the time you have made good, your party is in the$
+cold shade of opposition, and there are no jobs going.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head, and returned immediately to the question of the$
+missing reef, as though he wished to take the subject from his own$
+personal affairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You say that it would cost us a lot of money if the reef was proved,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it costing us a lot now?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is. As a matter of fact,‚M-^@M-^] he confessed, ‚M-^@M-^\the actual reef is$
+costing nothing, or next to nothing, because El Mograb is helping me. In$
+our own business‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, in the Syndicate‚M-^@M-^Tour expenses are$
+more or less small; but I am doing a little independent buying, and that$
+has meant the spending of money. I am taking up all the ground to the$
+south of the Angera‚M-^@M-^Ta pretty expensive business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is rather worrying me, you know, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\your$
+scheme is ever so much too ambitious. I was figuring it out this$
+afternoon as I was sitting in my room, and I came to the conclusion$
+that, if the scheme as you outlined it to me yesterday went through, it$
+would mean your finding two millions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Three,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the other cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\but think what it means,$
+Maxell! Supposing it went through. Supposing we struck a reef, and the$
+reef continued, as I believe it will, through the country I am taking$
+up! Why, it may mean a hundred millions to me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other sighed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have reached the point where I think a hundred thousand is an$
+enormous sum,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\However, you know your own business best,$
+Cartwright. But I want to be satisfied in the matter in which we are$
+associated together, that my liability does not exceed my power to pay.$
+And there is another matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright guessed the ‚M-^@M-^\other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was looking over your titles this afternoon,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\and I see$
+no reference to the old Spanish working. I remember that you told me a$
+Spaniard had taken up a considerable stretch of country and had$
+exhausted his capital trying to prove the reef‚M-^@M-^TSe√±or Brigot, wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+that his name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded curtly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A drunkard‚M-^@M-^Tand a bad lot,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\His moral character doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt count so far as the details go; what does$
+matter is that if your theory is correct, the reef must run through his$
+property. What are you going to do about that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Buy him out,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+He rose abruptly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym walking up to the Sok,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Come along?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They tramped up the long, steep hill-street together, and they did not$
+speak till they had passed through the ancient gate into the unrelieved$
+gloom which lies outside the city.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand you, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tyou take an old man‚M-^@M-^Ys view of things,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said Cartwright irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre comparatively young, you‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+good-looker. Why the devil don‚M-^@M-^Yt you marry, and marry money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you ever tried to marry money?‚M-^@M-^] he asked dryly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said the other after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\but I should think it is pretty$
+simple.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try it,‚M-^@M-^] said the laconic Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\It is simple in books, but in real$
+life it is next to impossible. I go about a great deal in society of all$
+kinds, and I can tell you that I have never yet met an eligible spinster$
+with money‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, large money. I agree with you,‚M-^@M-^] he went on$
+after a while, ‚M-^@M-^\a man like myself should marry. And he should marry$
+well. I could give a woman a good position, but she‚M-^@M-^Ys got to be the$
+right kind of woman. There are some times when I‚M-^@M-^Ym just frantic about my$
+position. I am getting older‚M-^@M-^TI am forty-seven next birthday‚M-^@M-^Tand every$
+day that slips past is a day lost. I ought to be married, but I can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+afford a wife. It is a blackguardly thing to talk about money in$
+connection with marriage and yet somehow I can think of nothing$
+else‚M-^@M-^Twhenever the thought arises in my mind I see an imaginary beauty$
+sitting on a big bag of gold!‚M-^@M-^] He chuckled to himself. ‚M-^@M-^\Let‚M-^@M-^Ys go back,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the big Sok always gives me the creeps.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Something lumbered past him in the darkness, some big, overpowering$
+beast with an unpleasant smell, and a guttural voice cried in Arabic:$
+‚M-^@M-^\Beware!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Camels!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright briefly. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre bringing in the stuff for$
+the morning market. The night‚M-^@M-^Ys young yet, Maxell. Let us go up to the$
+theatre.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt even know the theatre was open.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is called theatre by courtesy,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\the$
+inhabitants refer to it as the circus. It‚M-^@M-^Ys a big wooden place on the$
+sea edge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know it, I know it,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\What is being played? The only$
+people I have ever seen there have been Spanish artistes‚M-^@M-^Tand pretty bad$
+artistes, too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, there‚M-^@M-^Ys a treat for you. It is an English company, or rather, a$
+variety company with a number of English turns,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\We$
+might do worse‚M-^@M-^Tat least, I might,‚M-^@M-^] he added ominously.$
+$
+When they reached the theatre they found it sparsely filled. Cartwright$
+took one of the open boxes, and his companion settled himself into a$
+corner to smoke. The turns were of the kind which are usually to be met$
+with on the Levant; a tawdrily attired lady sang a humorous song in$
+Spanish, the humour being frankly indecent. There were a juggler and a$
+man with performing dogs, and then ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^] was announced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, turning to the programme.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may even be Irish,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell dryly.$
+$
+The wheezy little orchestra played a few bars and the girl came on. She$
+was pretty‚M-^@M-^Tthere was no doubt about that‚M-^@M-^Tand of a prettiness which$
+satisfied both men. She was also British or American, for the song she$
+sang was in a French with which both men were familiar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is horrible to see an English girl in a place like this and in such$
+company,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder where she‚M-^@M-^Ys staying,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, half to himself, and a$
+contemptuous little smile curled Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going to rescue her from her infamous surroundings?‚M-^@M-^] he asked,$
+and Cartwright snapped round on him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wish to heaven you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic, Maxell. That‚M-^@M-^Ys twice this$
+evening‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, snicking off the ash of his cigar. ‚M-^@M-^\I am in a$
+cynical mood to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He raised his hands to applaud the girl as she bowed herself from the$
+stage, and glanced round the house. Three boxes away was a small party$
+of men, whom he judged were the sons of prosperous members of the$
+Spanish colony. Their fingers flashed with diamonds, their cigarettes$
+burnt from jewelled holders. Cartwright followed the direction of the$
+other‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys made a hit, that Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\These fellows will be$
+tumbling over one another to present her with verbal bouquets. I wonder$
+where she lives!‚M-^@M-^] he said again.$
+$
+Presently the young men rose in a body and left the box, and Cartwright$
+grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you mind hanging on here whilst I go outside?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a bit,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\Where are you off to? To find out where$
+she lives?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you go again,‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I think Tangier makes you$
+liverish.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When he had got to the promenade, the men had disappeared, but a$
+question directed to the head attendant revealed, as he had expected,$
+the objective of the little party at the stage door.$
+$
+The stage door was reached from the outside of the theatre and involved$
+a journey over rubble and brick heaps. Presently he came to an open$
+doorway, where sat a solitary half-caste smoking a pipe and reading an$
+old _Heraldo_.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, _hombre_,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in Spanish, ‚M-^@M-^\have you seen my three$
+friends come in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] nodded the man; ‚M-^@M-^\they have just entered.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He indicated the direction, which lay through a dark and smelly passage.$
+$
+Cartwright walked along this stuffy hallway, and, turning the corner,$
+came upon an interesting group gathered about a closed door, against$
+which one, and the least sober, of the party was hammering. Near by$
+stood a small, stout man in soiled evening dress, grinning his approval,$
+and it was clear that the visitors were at once known and welcome.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open the door, my dream of joy,‚M-^@M-^] hiccupped the young man, hammering at$
+the panel. ‚M-^@M-^\We have come to bring you homage and adoration‚M-^@M-^Ttell her to$
+open the door, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he addressed the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, and$
+the small man minced forward and spoke in English.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is all right, my dear. Some friends of mine wish to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A voice inside, which Cartwright recognised, answered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not see them. Tell them to go away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You hear?‚M-^@M-^] said the manager, shrugging his shoulders. ‚M-^@M-^\She will not see$
+you. Now go back to your seats and let me persuade her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or!‚M-^@M-^] He raised his eyebrows to the unexpected apparition of$
+Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you doing here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is forbidden to enter the theatre through the saloon of artistes,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the small man pompously. ‚M-^@M-^\If Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your friend, you must$
+wait for her until the performance is over.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright took no notice. He was a tall man of athletic build and$
+shouldering his way past the others with no difficulty, he tapped on the$
+panel.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\here is an English visitor wants to see you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English?‚M-^@M-^] said the voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Come in for the love of Mike!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The door was opened, and a girl with a silk kimono pulled over her stage$
+dress, offered him a smiling welcome. The young Spaniard who had been$
+hammering on the panel of the door would have followed, but Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+arm barred him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want this fellow?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do I want him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady bitterly, ‚M-^@M-^\do I want the scarlet$
+fever or measles? You bet I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want him. He‚M-^@M-^Ys been pestering me ever$
+since I‚M-^@M-^Yve been here.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you hear what the lady says?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, speaking in Spanish.$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does not desire your acquaintance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My father owns this theatre,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man loudly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then he‚M-^@M-^Ys got a rotten property,‚M-^@M-^] replied the calm Cartwright.$
+$
+The Spaniard turned in a rage to his soiled satellite.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You will put this man out at once, Jose, or there will be trouble for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little man shrugged his helplessness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said in English, ‚M-^@M-^\you see my unhappy position. The se√±or is$
+the son of my proprietor and it will be bad for me if you stay. I ask$
+you as a friend and caballero to go at once and spare me misfortune.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright looked at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Must you go on again in this infernal place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, laughter and admiration in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens if you chuck this infernal job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym fired,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve a ten weeks‚M-^@M-^Y contract with these$
+people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you get?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two hundred and fifty pesetas a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+wonderful salary, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How many more weeks have you to go before your contract is finished?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another four,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\we‚M-^@M-^Yre playing in Cadiz next week, in Seville$
+the week after, then Malaga, then Granada.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you like it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like it!‚M-^@M-^] the scorn in her voice was her answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The dresses belong to the troupe, I guess,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Get into your$
+street clothes and I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, eyeing him narrowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good your lost contract,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an English girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Irish,‚M-^@M-^] she corrected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean Irish,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an Irish girl doing$
+this kind of thing with a lot of horrible half-breeds. You‚M-^@M-^Yve talent$
+enough for London or Paris. What about Paris? I know any number of$
+people there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Could you get me a good engagement?‚M-^@M-^] she asked eagerly.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys your name, anyway?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never mind about my name. Smith, Brown, Jones, Robinson‚M-^@M-^Tanything you$
+like.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was the agitated little manager who interfered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you must not persuade this lady to leave the theatre. I$
+have her under heavy penalties. I can bring her before the judge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now just forget that!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there is no judge in Tangier.$
+She is a British subject, and the most you can do is to take her before$
+the British Consul.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When she returns to Spain‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said the little man growing apoplectic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She will not return to Spain. She will go to Gibraltar if she goes$
+anywhere,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and from Gibraltar she will be on the sea$
+until she reaches a British port.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will go to the Spanish Consul,‚M-^@M-^] screamed the little manager, clawing$
+the air. ‚M-^@M-^\I will not be robbed. You shall not interfere with my$
+business, you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Much of this, thought Cartwright, was intended for the glowering young$
+Spaniard who stood in the background. He went outside, closed the door$
+and stood with his back toward it. On a whispered instruction from his$
+employer‚M-^@M-^Ys son, whose hands were now flickering fire as he gesticulated$
+in his excitement, Jose the manager disappeared, and returned a few$
+minutes later with two stalwart stage hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Will you leave this theatre at once and quietly?‚M-^@M-^] demanded the foaming$
+manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not leave the theatre until I am ready,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+if I leave otherwise, I shall certainly not leave quietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The manager stood back with a melodramatic gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eject the caballero,‚M-^@M-^] he said finely.$
+$
+The two men hesitated. Then one came forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The se√±or must leave,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In good time, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+A hand gripped his arm, but instantly he had shaken free, and had driven$
+with all his strength at the man‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw. The stage hand dropped like a$
+log. He pushed at the door behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put your kimono over your things,‚M-^@M-^] he said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\You can send the$
+stage kit back to-morrow. There is going to be a rough house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All right,‚M-^@M-^] said a voice behind him, and the girl slipped out, still in$
+her kimono and carrying a bundle of clothes under her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know the way out? I‚M-^@M-^Yll follow you. Now, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he said flippantly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going‚M-^@M-^Tquietly.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+$
+HE left behind him a pandemonium of sound and a scintillation of$
+flickering diamonds. He found the girl waiting for him in the darkness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Br-r-r! It‚M-^@M-^Ys cold!‚M-^@M-^] she shivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you staying?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the little hotel opposite the British Consulate,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt much of a place, but it was the only room I could get‚M-^@M-^Tat the$
+price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better not go there,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll send for your boxes in the$
+morning. Give me those clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took them from her and put them under his arm, and she fell in by his$
+side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad to be out of it,‚M-^@M-^] she said breathlessly, taking his arm;$
+‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a dog‚M-^@M-^Ys life. I was going to quit to-morrow. Those boys have been$
+following me round ever since I came to Tangier. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better go back to my hotel, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a moment; ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+pretty tough crowd, these Spaniards, and though I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand their$
+beastly language, I know just what kind of happy holiday they‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+planning for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were in the town, passing up the street of the mosque, when she$
+asked him:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you taking me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the Continental,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like this?‚M-^@M-^] she said in dismay, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have an office in this street,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\you can go in and dress.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you outside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He showed her into the tiny room which served as the headquarters of the$
+Angera Gold Mining Syndicate, and sat on the irregular stone steps,$
+waiting until she was dressed. Presently she came out, a presentable and$
+an attractive figure.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just thought,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you had better to go the$
+Central‚M-^@M-^TI am staying at the Continental and it wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt look nice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been thinking something of the sort myself,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What about$
+my broken engagement? Were you joking when you said you would pay? I$
+hate talking about money, but I am broke‚M-^@M-^TJose owes me a week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good the money to-morrow,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I can give you a tenner$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the idea?‚M-^@M-^] she asked him again. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve read a lot of books, and$
+I know the knight errant business backwards. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt strike me as$
+being a something-for-nothing man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\It occurred to me when I saw you on the$
+stage, that you might be useful. I want a person in Paris I can$
+trust‚M-^@M-^Tsomebody who could look after my interests.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a business woman,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I hate business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Business is done by men,‚M-^@M-^] said he significantly. ‚M-^@M-^\And there are a few$
+men I want you to keep track of. Do you understand that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see,‚M-^@M-^] she said at last. ‚M-^@M-^\It is better than I thought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He did not trouble to ask her what she had thought, or what she imagined$
+he had planned, but saw her into the hotel, arranged for a room, and$
+walked slowly back to the Continental. He was in the vestibule of that$
+hotel before he remembered that he had left an eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel$
+and Member of Parliament smoking his cigar in a _loge_ of the Tangier$
+circus.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I missed you,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell the next morning. ‚M-^@M-^\When you remembered and$
+came to pick me up, I was on my way back‚M-^@M-^Twe must have passed somewhere$
+in the little Sok. What happened last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing much,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\I went round and saw the girl.$
+She was very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How amusing?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, just amusing.‚M-^@M-^] Vaguely: ‚M-^@M-^\I found her annoyed by the attention which$
+was being paid to her by a veritable Spanish hidalgo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you sailed in and rescued her, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\And what happened$
+to her after she was rescued?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I saw her home to her hotel, and there the matter ended. By the way,$
+she leaves by the _Gibel Musa_ for Gibraltar this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] Maxell looked absently at the letter he had in his hand, folded it$
+and put it away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is the mail in?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright, interested, and Maxell nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve had your daily letter from your kiddie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is not a baby letter, but it is very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How old is she?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She must be nine or ten,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is just coincidence, or whether it is fate,‚M-^@M-^] mused$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is a coincidence?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve got a kid to look after, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym in a sort of way$
+responsible for a bright lad. Mine is less interesting than yours, I$
+think. Anyway, he‚M-^@M-^Ys a boy and a sort of cousin. He has two fool parents$
+who were born to slavery‚M-^@M-^Tthe sort of people who are content to work for$
+somebody all their lives and regard revolt against their condition as an$
+act of impiety. I‚M-^@M-^Yve only seen the kid once, and he struck me as the$
+sort who might break loose from that kind of life and take a chance.$
+Otherwise, I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have interested myself in him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How far does your interest extend?‚M-^@M-^] asked Maxell curiously. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not$
+the sort of person, I should imagine, who would take up the unfortunate$
+poor as a hobby.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a something-for-nothing man, in fact,‚M-^@M-^] laughed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been told that twice in twenty-four hours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who was the other person‚M-^@M-^Tthe actress?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright roared with laughter and slapped the other on the knee.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No, I am not a something-for-nothing$
+person. I‚M-^@M-^Ym one of those optimists who plant fir cones so that I shall$
+have some good firewood for my old age. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what sort of a man$
+Timothy will make, but, as I say, he shapes good, and anyway, you and I$
+are in the same boat.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except this,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\that from what you say, you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+particularly interested in your prot√©g√©, and you don‚M-^@M-^Yt really care$
+whether he shapes good or shapes bad.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys true,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an experiment.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little girl is something more than that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell quietly;$
+‚M-^@M-^\she‚M-^@M-^Ys the only living thing I have any real affection for‚M-^@M-^Tshe is my$
+dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your niece, eh? Well, that gives you an interest which I have not. I$
+never had a niece and I should just hate to be called uncle, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Their conversation was interrupted at this point by the arrival of a$
+small man dressed in his best clothes. On his brow was a frown which was$
+intended to be terrible, but was slightly amusing. Jose Ferreira had$
+dressed and prepared himself for an interview which, as he had described$
+to his friends, could not fail to be at once ‚M-^@M-^\terrifying and vital.‚M-^@M-^]$
+For, as he had said: ‚M-^@M-^\This man has sliced my life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He began his speech to Cartwright as he had rehearsed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Estoy indignado‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T_‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright cut him short with an expression of mock fear.$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Horroroso!_ You are indignant, are you? Well, come, little man, and$
+tell me why you are indignant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] said the man solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\you have put upon me a humiliation and$
+a shame which all my life I shall regret.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The conversation was in Spanish, but Maxell was an excellent Spanish$
+scholar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, before Jose, still labouring under the$
+sense of his wrongs, could get going again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen to him and discover,‚M-^@M-^] mocked Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have taken from his$
+incomparable company its joy and its gem.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In other words, the amiable Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, yes, se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] broke in Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\For me it is ruin! The money I have$
+spent to make my company perfect! It is financed by one who is the$
+greatest man in Tangier and it is his son who tells me that, unless I$
+bring back this lady‚M-^@M-^Tfor me there is the street and the gutter,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+wept.$
+$
+Maxell looked slyly at his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys another chance for you to plant a fir cone,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+you find some use for this gentleman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright was not smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] he said crisply, ‚M-^@M-^\you are, as all Spain knows, a thief$
+and a rogue. If you associate with bigger thieves and bigger scoundrels,$
+that is your business. I can only tell you that you may think yourself$
+lucky I did not bring this case before the Spanish Consul. I assure you,$
+you would never have put your foot in Tangier again after the stories I$
+have heard about you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little Spaniard was open-mouthed and impressed. He was also a little$
+frightened. Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation had been at a venture, but he argued$
+that it was scarcely likely that, in an establishment of the description$
+which Mr. Ferreira controlled, there could have been no incidents which$
+reflected upon the manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything which is said about me is a lie!‚M-^@M-^] said the little man$
+vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I have lived a life of the highest virtue! To-day I$
+complain to the British Consul, and we shall see!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Complain,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This chance I will give you.‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Ferreira wagged a fat, stumpy$
+finger. ‚M-^@M-^\Restore to me Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and the matter shall go no$
+farther.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady has left Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] said the other calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\so it is clear$
+to you that I cannot restore her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She has not left,‚M-^@M-^] vociferated the Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\We had a man to watch the$
+boat leaving for the _Gibel Musa_ and she did not leave the pier.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She left the beach,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright patiently; ‚M-^@M-^\she was rowed out$
+by a boatman from the Cecil. At this moment she is half-way to$
+Gibraltar.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira groaned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is ruin for me,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps for you also,‚M-^@M-^] he added$
+ominously. ‚M-^@M-^\I can do no less than depart for Paris to lay this matter$
+before my excellent patron, Se√±or Don‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright jerked his head to the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Get out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and turned his attention to the newspaper which he$
+had picked up from the table.$
+$
+Maxell waited until the little man had gone, still seething with his$
+‚M-^@M-^\indignado,‚M-^@M-^] then turned to Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is rather a serious matter, Cartwright; what has happened to the$
+girl?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you hear? I have sent her to Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt leave a dog in that company. And from Gibraltar she goes home$
+by the first P. & O.,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you ‚M-^@M-^Xhming‚M-^@M-^Y about?‚M-^@M-^] snarled his companion. ‚M-^@M-^\The girl$
+is gone. I shall not see her again. It was an act of charity. Do you$
+disapprove?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you felt so bad about it. No, I$
+think you‚M-^@M-^Yve done the girl a very good turn. But in these days one$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt expect‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blessed is he that expecteth nothing, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright$
+sententiously, ‚M-^@M-^\for he shall not be disappointed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose that$
+the proprietor, whoever he is, cares a snap of his fingers about the$
+matter‚M-^@M-^Tit is his infernal son who will fire the adorable Jose.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+That afternoon the two men had an interview on the outskirts of the town$
+with a very plainly dressed Moor, who came to them so cautiously that$
+the observers might have been pardoned if they thought he was a$
+criminal. In the eyes of the divine rulers of Morocco he was something$
+more than a criminal, because he was an emissary of El Mograb, the$
+Pretender. There was a price upon the messenger‚M-^@M-^Ys head, and his caution$
+was, therefore, commendable. He brought a letter from El Mograb to$
+Cartwright, and it was a message of cheer.$
+$
+Maxell and his friend had gone out early in the afternoon and had waited$
+two hours under a scorching sun for the courier to arrive. For a man of$
+law, the fact that he was coquetting with the Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy did not$
+distress Maxell, who knew the history of the country too well to worry$
+very much about Sultan or Pretender. The Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys reign, marked with the$
+turbulence of people and the self-indulgence of monarch, was already$
+doomed. His uncle, El Mograb, a born leader of men and captain of seven$
+thousand well-armed soldiers, was but waiting the psychological moment$
+to strike; and Adbul, with his motor-cars and brass bedstead, his$
+geegaws and his frippery, would disappear into the limbo which is$
+especially reserved for extravagant and unstable rulers.$
+$
+The news from El Mograb was good. It reconfirmed the concession which$
+one of his shereefs had made on his behalf, and sent a message in$
+flowery Arabic‚M-^@M-^Ta message of thanks to the man who had supplied him with$
+the very necessary rifles.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That was news to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright as they rode back to the town. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you were gun-running, Maxell, or that you were so solid with$
+El Mograb.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I like El Mograb,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the many Moors who have$
+impressed me. You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that I have been visiting Morocco since$
+I was a boy and most of the chiefs are known to me personally. I knew El$
+Mograb‚M-^@M-^Ys brother, who was killed at Tetuan, and when he was a favourite$
+in court circles he entertained me at Fez.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his word worth?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is worth all the contracts that ever went to Somerset House for$
+stamping,‚M-^@M-^] said the other with emphasis. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you can go ahead with$
+your scheme.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go back to London and raise the money,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We shall want a$
+couple of millions eventually, but half a million will do to go on with.$
+You had better be with me in the big scheme, Maxell. There is nothing to$
+lose for you. You‚M-^@M-^Yll be in on the ground floor. What is the good of your$
+pottering about with your little Company‚M-^@M-^TI mean the Parent Company?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have faith in that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I know just the amount of my$
+indebtedness.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\The big scheme may mean$
+millions to you, and I shall want your help and guidance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell hesitated. The lure was dazzling, the prize was immense. But it$
+meant risks which he was not prepared to take. He knew something of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys financial methods; he had seen them in their working, and$
+had done not a little on one occasion to save Cartwright from the$
+consequences of his own cleverness. Yet, as he argued, Cartwright would$
+have no difficulty in raising the money from the general public, and his$
+presence on the board would certainly be a guarantee against his$
+companion departing from the narrow path.$
+$
+Although it was not generally known that he was associated in any of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises, there had been a whisper of an inquiry in$
+influential quarters, and it had been hinted to him that, on the whole,$
+it would be better if he kept himself aloof from the gentleman who,$
+admirable business man as he was, had a passion for enterprises which$
+occasionally verged upon the illegal. But those influential quarters had$
+not whispered anything in the shape of a definite promise that his$
+welfare was entirely in their keeping and that his future would not be$
+overlooked.$
+$
+He was an ambitious man, but his ambitions ran in realisable directions.$
+The services he had rendered to the Government were such as deserved a$
+recognition, and the only question was what form that recognition would$
+take? His knowledge of languages qualified him for an important$
+appointment under the Foreign Office; but the Foreign Office was a close$
+preserve and difficult to break into. There were too many permanent$
+officials who regarded the service as a family affair, and were jealous$
+of patronage outside their own charmed circle.$
+$
+He went in to lunch that day to find Cartwright reading a telegram which$
+he folded up and put into his pocket upon the other‚M-^@M-^Ys appearance.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little friend has arrived in Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+Maxell looked at him curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens now?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym sending her home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys voice was brisk and he spoke in the manner of a man$
+referring to a topic too unimportant to be discussed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^] pursued Maxell, and the other shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have given her a letter of introduction to a friend of mine,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+carelessly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have one or two theatrical interests in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell said nothing, and could have dismissed the matter as lightly as$
+his companion, for the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys future scarcely interested him.$
+$
+She had been but a figure on the stage; her personality, her very$
+appearance, left no definite impression. But if he was not interested in$
+the girl, he was interested in Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private mind. Here was a man$
+of whom he could not know too much. And somehow he felt that he had$
+hardly cracked the surface of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys character though he had known$
+him for years, and though they were working together to a common end.$
+$
+The way of a man with a maid is wonderful, but it is also instructive to$
+the cold-blooded onlooker, who discovers in that way a kind of creature$
+he has never met before; a new man, so entirely different from the$
+familiar being he had met in club or drawing-room as to be almost$
+unrecognisable. And he wanted to know just this side of Cartwright,$
+because it was the side on which he had scarcely any information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you won‚M-^@M-^Yt see her again?‚M-^@M-^] he said, playing with his knife and$
+looking abstractedly out of the window.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt think so,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, and then, with a sudden$
+irritation: ‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you driving at, Maxell? I may see the$
+girl‚M-^@M-^TI go to music-halls, and it is hardly likely I should miss her.$
+Naturally I am interested in the lady I have rescued from this kind of$

+He tried to carry war into the enemy‚M-^@M-^Ys camp and failed, for Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+blue eyes met his steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know what she looks like,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am not likely to$
+fall in love with a lady who left absolutely no impression upon me.‚M-^@M-^]$

+He left next day on the boat for Cadiz, _en route_ to Paris and London,$
+and he and Cartwright had as a fellow-passenger a shabby little man$
+whose belongings were packed in an American-cloth suit-case inscribed in$
+flourishing capitals, evidently by the owner, ‚M-^@M-^\Jose Ferreira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira spent most of his time on the ship‚M-^@M-^Ys deck, biting his nails$

+                              CHAPTER III$
+$
+$
+MAXELL did not stay many hours in Paris. The Sud Express landed him in$
+the French capital at seven in the morning. He left Paris by the midday$
+train for London. The Long Vacation was drawing to an end, and there$
+were briefs of certain importance requiring examination. There was also$
+a consultation with the Attorney-General on an interpretation of a$
+clause in the new Shipping Act, and he was also due to address his$
+constituents before the reassembling of Parliament.$
+$
+He might ruminate in vain to find one attractive feature of his$
+programme. Parliament wearied him, and the ordinary practices of the law$
+no longer gave him pleasure.$
+$
+There was an interest in the work he was doing for the Government, and$
+if he had the faintest hint of pleasure in his immediate prospects, the$
+cause was to be found in the vexed problems centring about this new, and$
+loosely drawn, shipping law. It was a measure which had been passed in a$
+hurry, and when the acid test of litigation had been applied, some of$
+its weak points had been discovered.$
+$
+The weakest of these points was one affecting the load-line. In an$
+action heard before a High Court Judge, the doubtful clause had been$
+interpreted so as to render the Act a dead letter; and there were$
+particular and especial Governmental reasons why the appeal which the$
+Government had made from the verdict of the lower Court should upset$
+that decision.$
+$
+There is no need to give the particulars of the great dispute, which$
+arose over the three words ‚M-^@M-^\or otherwise loaded,‚M-^@M-^] and it is only$
+necessary to say that, before he had reached London, Mr. Maxell had$
+discovered a way for the Government out of their difficulty.$
+$
+It was this opinion which he delivered to a relieved Attorney-General,$
+and, with the new argument, the Government were able to present so$
+strong a case to the Court of Appeal, that a month after his return the$
+verdict of the lower Court was reversed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney-General, ‚M-^@M-^\the devils can take it to the House$
+of Lords now and still lose‚M-^@M-^Tthanks to your brain wave, Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were smoking in the Crown Room at the Law Courts after the decision$
+had been delivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where have you been for your holiday, by the way?‚M-^@M-^] asked the Attorney$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco?‚M-^@M-^] The Attorney nodded thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you hear anything of$
+friend Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We were staying at the same hotel,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A weird person,‚M-^@M-^] said the thoughtful Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\A very curious$
+man‚M-^@M-^Twhat a Chancellor that fellow would make!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He never struck me that way,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know him well‚M-^@M-^TI mean, are you a particular friend of his?‚M-^@M-^]$
+demanded the Attorney.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\I know him‚M-^@M-^Tso many men in the law$
+know him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not by any chance associating with him in business now, are$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell promptly.$
+$
+It was a lie and he knew it was a lie. It was told deliberately from the$
+desire to stand well in the eyes of his friends. He knew Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reputation well enough, and just how he was regarded by the party whom$
+he had served for three years. Cartwright had been Member for a London$
+borough, but had resigned. ‚M-^@M-^\Pressure of business‚M-^@M-^] was the excuse he$
+gave, but there were people who said that it was owing to the pressure$
+of the Party Whips, who smelt a somewhat unsavoury case coming into$
+Court with Cartwright figuring prominently.$
+$
+There is no way of proving or disproving the statement, because the case$
+in which Cartwright most decidedly was interested was withdrawn from the$
+list at the last moment. The uncharitable say that it cost Cartwright a$
+small fortune to bring about this withdrawal, and certainly one of the$
+ladies interested (she was a small-part actress at the Hippoceus) gave$
+up her stage work and had been living in affluence ever since.$
+Cartwright pooh-poohed the suggestion that the case held anything$
+sensational‚M-^@M-^Tbut he did not enter political life again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with him,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney simply.$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an awfully nice fellow and I suppose he is as straight and as$
+sound as the best man in the City. But he‚M-^@M-^Ys a shifty fellow‚M-^@M-^Tjust a$
+little bit‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\a little wrong. You understand, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tor$
+shall we say slightly shop-soiled?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is certainly a brilliant man,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, not desirous of$
+defending his friend too vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I suppose he is,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\All men like that are$
+brilliant. What a pity his genius does not run in a smooth channel, but$
+must follow the course of a burning cracker, here, there and everywhere,$
+exploding at every turn!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped down from the table, on the edge of which he had been sitting$
+and pulled off his robe.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad to know you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with Cartwright, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said.$
+$
+Maxell did not attempt to probe beneath the surface of his$
+twice-repeated remark.$
+$
+He went back to Cavendish Square to his flat and to a tiny, solemn-eyed$
+little girl who had been brought up from Hindhead that day on her$
+monthly visit to ‚M-^@M-^\Uncle Max.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright had not accompanied his friend to England, and with good$
+reasons. A great deal of his work was carried out in Paris, where he had$
+an important financial backing. He occupied a flat overlooking the$
+imposing, but none too convenient, Avenue of the Grand Army. His home$
+was at the unfashionable end of this interminable thoroughfare, which$
+meant that his rooms were larger and his rent cheaper, and that he was$
+freer from observation than he would have been had he lived according to$
+his means or station in a luxurious flat nearer the Etoil.$
+$
+He had a board meeting to attend, an informal board meeting, it is true,$
+but none the less important.$
+$
+Cartwright was the chairman and managing director of the London and$
+Paris Gold Syndicate, a flourishing concern which held big blocks of$
+shares in various land and gold-mining companies, and controlled three$
+mines of its own on the West Rand. Though a Company drawing a modest$
+revenue from its Johannesburg property, its operations were not confined$
+to gold development pure and simple. It was, in fact, an outside$
+broker‚M-^@M-^Ys on a grand scale. It gambled heavily and gambled wisely. The$
+shareholders seldom received less than a twelve and a half per cent.$
+dividend, and there were years when in addition it paid a bonus equal to$
+its own share capital.$
+$
+It numbered its clients at one hundred and fifty thousand, the majority$
+being small people who preferred speculation to investment‚M-^@M-^Tcountry$
+parsons, doctors and the small gamblers who lived fearfully on the$
+fringe of high finance. The shares were at a premium and Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+interest brought him a considerable sum annually. What probably$
+attracted the little speculator was the knowledge of the Company‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reserve, which stood in the balance-sheet at a respectable figure. It$
+was the question of these reserves that occupied the attention of the$
+four quiet men who met informally in the room of a Paris hotel.$
+$
+There were three to one against Cartwright, because none of his$
+companions could see eye to eye with him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is too dangerous, M. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Gribber, whose nationality$
+was suspect; ‚M-^@M-^\our risks are already high and we cannot afford, in my$
+judgment, to extend them. The money would be subscribed over and over$
+again if you went to the English public.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt we make the profit?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\we could borrow from our$
+reserve.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That we can‚M-^@M-^Yt touch!‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the cautious Gribber, shaking his$
+head violently. ‚M-^@M-^\My faith, no, we cannot touch that! For it is certain$
+that the lean years will come when our clients will require their$
+dividends.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not pursue the subject. There were other ways of$
+financing his Moorish scheme.$
+$
+The Benson Syndicate, for example.$
+$
+He spoke eloquently of this new venture, which was to have its$
+headquarters in Paris, and would be under the eye of his sceptical$
+co-directors. He mentioned names glibly and easily‚M-^@M-^Tnames that carried$
+weight in the financial world. The three men agreed that the Benson$
+Syndicate had the appearance of a safe investment.$
+$

+$
+More important was the business which brought Alfred Cartwright to the$
+St. Lazaire Station to meet a passenger a week later.$
+$
+She sprang from the train and looked round with doubting face, which$
+lighted the moment she saw the saturnine Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My! I am relieved,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I was scared to think you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be$
+here to meet me, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd only got a few pounds left.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You got my wire?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, and she smiled, showing two rows of pearly$
+teeth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym still mystified,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What is it you want me to do in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us eat first and talk afterwards,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You must be hungry.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym starving!‚M-^@M-^] she laughed.$
+$
+He had a car waiting for her, and whisked her off to a little street$
+leading from the Boulevard des Italiens, where one of the best$
+restaurants in Paris is situated. The girl looked about her with an$
+approving air. The gaiety and luxury of the place appealed to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My word!‚M-^@M-^] she said enviously; ‚M-^@M-^\do you come to lunch here every day?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know this place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve seen it,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but a three-franc dinner at Duval‚M-^@M-^Ys has$
+been my limit so far.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She told him how she had come to the Continent as a dancer, and had$
+‚M-^@M-^\starred‚M-^@M-^] in a tiny little cabaret in Montmartre as one of the ‚M-^@M-^\dashing$
+Sisters Jones,‚M-^@M-^] before she had been seen by the impresario who was$
+recruiting material for his tour through the Levant.$
+$
+Cartwright judged her to be nineteen, knew her to be extremely pretty,$
+and guessed that, under certain conditions, she would be presentable$
+even to the best of the circles in which he moved. He wondered, with a$
+grim smile, what Maxell, that austere and fastidious man, would say if$
+he knew that the girl was with him in Paris. Would Maxell accept her? He$
+thought not. Maxell was a thought straitlaced and in some ways was a$
+bore. But Maxell was necessary. He was a brilliant lawyer, and moreover$
+stood well with the Government, and there might come a time when Maxell$
+would be immensely useful. He could well afford to give the lawyer a$
+slice of the pickings he intended making, because Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys wants were$
+few and his ambitions on the modest side.$
+$
+Cartwright thought in millions. Maxell was a five-figure man. If all$
+went well with Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys scheme, undoubtedly he could well afford the$
+five figures.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happened to your friend?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl, as though divining his$
+thoughts: ‚M-^@M-^\The man you told me I was to keep away from. Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+want him to see me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does it really matter?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys in England, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is he?‚M-^@M-^] She was curious.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, a friend of mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And who are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, facing him squarely. ‚M-^@M-^\If I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see$
+anything of you in Paris, that Smith, Brown or Robinson business isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+quite good enough. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me, but I want to know who I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+working for, and what is the kind of work you want me to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright pinched his neck‚M-^@M-^Ta nervous little trick of his when he was$
+thinking.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business interests here,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt want me for an office?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously. ‚M-^@M-^\My education$
+is perfectly rotten.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you for an office,‚M-^@M-^] he replied with a smile. ‚M-^@M-^\And yet$
+in a sense I want you to do office work. I have a little syndicate here,$
+which is known as the Benson Syndicate. Benson is my name‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Or the name you go by,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How sharp you are! Well, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your name, if it$
+comes to that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She made no reply and he went on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want somebody in Paris I can rely upon; somebody who will receive$
+money, transmit it to the Benson Syndicate, and re-invest that money in$
+such concerns as I shall indicate.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt use long words,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\How do you know I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to rob$
+you? Nobody‚M-^@M-^Ys ever trusted me with money before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He might have told her that she would not be trusted with a great deal$
+at a time and that she would be carefully watched. He preferred,$
+however, an explanation more flattering to his new assistant. And not$
+only was it flattering, but it contained a big grain of truth,$
+expressing, to an extent, Alfred Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys creed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Women are more honest than men,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I should think twice before$
+I put a man‚M-^@M-^Teven my best friend‚M-^@M-^Tin the position I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting you. It$
+will be a simple matter, and I shall pay you well. You can live at one$
+of the best hotels‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, it is absolutely necessary that you should.$
+You may‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\you may be Madam Benson, a rich Englishwoman.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him from under perplexed brows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the good of asking me to do that?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a tone of$
+disappointment. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were going to give me a job I could do.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Ym a fool at business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can remain a fool,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing to do except$
+carry out a certain routine, which I shall explain to you so that you$
+can‚M-^@M-^Yt possibly make a mistake. Here is a job which gives you plenty of$
+time, pays you well, gives you good clothes and an auto. Now, are you$
+going to be a sensible girl and take it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She thought a moment, then nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it means lunching here every day, I‚M-^@M-^Yll take it,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+Thus was formed the remarkable Benson Syndicate, about which so much has$
+been written, and so many theories evolved. For, if the truth be told,$
+the Benson Syndicate had no existence until Cartwright called it into$
+being in Ciro‚M-^@M-^Ys Restaurant. It was born of the opposition he had$
+received, and its creation was hastened by certain disquieting telegrams$
+which arrived almost every hour from London.$
+$
+Cartwright was, as has been said, a man of many interests. The$
+door-plate of his office in Victoria Street, London, was covered with$
+the names of the companies which had their headquarters in the ornate$
+suite which he occupied. There were two other suites of offices in the$
+City of London for which Mr. Cartwright paid the rent, although he did$
+not pay it in his own name. There were syndicates and companies$
+innumerable, Development Syndicates, Exploitation Companies, Financial$
+and Mining Companies, all duly registered and all keeping one solicitor$
+busy; for the Companies Acts are tricky, and Cartwright was too clever a$
+man to contravene minor regulations.$
+$
+And to all these companies there were shareholders; some of them$
+contented, some‚M-^@M-^Tthe majority‚M-^@M-^Twholly dissatisfied with their lot, and$
+quite a large number who were wont to show their share certificates to$
+their friends as curiosities, and tell them the sad story of how they$
+were inveigled into investment.$
+$
+Only a clever company lawyer can describe in detail the tortuous$
+character of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys system of finance. It involved loans from one$
+company to another, very often on the security of shares in a third$
+company; it involved a system of over-drafts, drawn in favour of some$
+weakly member of his family, secured by the assets of one which could$
+show a bold face to the world, and was even quoted in the Stock Exchange$
+list; and divers other complicated transactions, which only the expert$
+mathematician could follow.$
+$
+Cartwright was a rich man, accounted a millionaire by his friends; but$
+he was that type of millionaire who was never at a loss for a thousand,$
+but who was generally hard up for ten thousand. He came to London much$
+against his will, in response to an urgent telegram, and, having cleared$
+the difficulties which his subordinates had found insuperable, he had a$
+few hours to attend to his private affairs before he took the train back$
+to Paris.$
+$
+His secretary produced a heap of small bills requiring settlement, and$
+going through these, he paused before one printed slip, and frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That boy‚M-^@M-^Ys school fees weren‚M-^@M-^Yt paid last term,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said the secretary. ‚M-^@M-^\If you remember, I mentioned the matter$
+to you when you were in London last. I was taking upon myself the$
+responsibility of paying the fees, if you hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt returned. The boy is$
+coming up to-day, by the way, sir, to be measured for some clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Coming here?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Cartwright, interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright picked up the bill.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he read. ‚M-^@M-^\What does T. A. C. stand for‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XTake A$
+Chance‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understood he was named after you‚M-^@M-^TTimothy Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the secretary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes; of course,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright grinned. ‚M-^@M-^\Still, Take A Chance isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a bad$
+name for a kid. When is he arriving?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He ought to be here now,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, looking at his watch. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+out and see.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He disappeared into the outer office, and presently returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The boy is here, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Would you like to see him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bring him in,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to meet this nephew, or$
+cousin, or whatever he is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He wondered vaguely what had induced him to take upon himself the$
+responsibility of the small child, and with remorseless judgment$
+analysed the reason as being personal vanity.$
+$
+The door opened and a child strode in. ‚M-^@M-^\Strode‚M-^@M-^] is the only word to$
+describe the quick, decisive movement of the bright-eyed lad who looked$
+with unflinching eye at Cartwright. Cartwright did not look at his$
+clothes, but at the grey, clear eyes, the firm mouth, extraordinarily$
+firm for a boy of fourteen, and the capable and not over-clean hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, son,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\So you‚M-^@M-^Yre my nephew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cousin, I think,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, critically examining the contents of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys table. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre Cousin Alfred, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym a cousin, am I? Yes, I suppose I am,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amused.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, ‚M-^@M-^\is that the school bill? The Head has been$
+rather baity about that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\‚M-^@M-^XBaity‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys a new one on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shirty,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy calmly. ‚M-^@M-^\Annoyed, I suppose, is the correct$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to be?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A financier,‚M-^@M-^] said T. A. C. Anderson promptly.$
+$
+He seated himself, leant his elbow on the desk and his head on his hand,$
+his eyes never leaving Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that‚M-^@M-^Ys a great scheme‚M-^@M-^Tfinance,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym a whale at$
+mathematics.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What particular branch of finance?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Other people‚M-^@M-^Ys finance,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy promptly; ‚M-^@M-^\the same business as$
+yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright threw back his head and laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And do you think you‚M-^@M-^Yd be able to keep twenty companies in the air at$
+the same time?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the air?‚M-^@M-^] the boy frowned. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, you mean going all at once? Rather!$
+Anyway, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The phrase struck Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take a chance? That‚M-^@M-^Ys curious. I called you Take A Chance Anderson just$

+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, they all call me that,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,$
+they‚M-^@M-^Yre bound to stick a label on to a fellow with an initial like mine.$
+Some of them call me ‚M-^@M-^XTin and Copper Anderson,‚M-^@M-^Y but most of them‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a rum kid,‚M-^@M-^] said his cousin. ‚M-^@M-^\You can come to lunch with me.‚M-^@M-^]$

+                               CHAPTER IV$
+$
+$
+MR. ALFRED CARTWRIGHT had the enviable faculty of placing outside of$
+his mind all subjects and persons which were unpleasant to think upon.$
+Possessing this power, he could as lightly dismiss the memory of$
+responsibilities, pleasant or unpleasant. He had scarcely left London$
+before he had waived Master T. A. C. Anderson into oblivion. To do him$
+justice, he had certainly speculated vaguely upon assuring his cousin‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+future; but his mind was so completely occupied with his own that there$
+was really not room for both‚M-^@M-^Tand Take A Chance Anderson had to go.$
+$
+He reached Paris by the evening train, and drove straight to the$
+apartment he had taken for his new prot√©g√©. He found her installed in a$
+very comfortable flat on the unfashionable side of the Seine, and was$
+welcomed with relief.$
+$
+Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had not entirely overcome her suspicions of the _bona$
+fides_ of her newfound acquaintance. Yet, since he had not made love to$
+her, but, on the contrary, had made it very clear that the part he$
+expected her to play in his schemes involved no loss of self-respect,$
+she was becoming reconciled to a relationship which, to say the least,$
+was a strange one. She had established herself in a third-floor office$
+on one of the boulevards, an uncomfortable and unaccustomed figure in an$
+environment which was wholly foreign to her experience, though there was$
+no need for her embarrassment, since she constituted the whole of the$
+staff, and the callers were confined to the postman and the concierge$
+who acted as office-cleaner.$
+$
+She was to learn, however, that a daily attendance at her ‚M-^@M-^\bureau‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute the whole of her duties, or fulfil all Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+requirements.$
+$
+It was not until after dinner that night that Cartwright revealed$
+himself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sadie, my young friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, between puffs of his cigar, ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+going to tell you just what I want you to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought I knew,‚M-^@M-^] she said, on her guard, and he laughed softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll never quite know what I want you to do,‚M-^@M-^] he said frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\until$
+I tell you. Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting it to you very straight. I want nothing$
+from you except service. And the service I require is of a kind which$
+you need not hesitate to give me. You‚M-^@M-^Yre an actress, and I can speak to$
+you more plainly than I could to some unsophisticated girl.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She wondered what was coming, but had not long to wait.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will tell you something,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\which is really more important$
+than my name, about which you showed so much curiosity. There is a man$
+in this city whom I want to get at.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is a man who has it in his power to ruin me‚M-^@M-^Ta drunken sot of a$
+fellow, without brain or imagination.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He went on to explain briefly that he himself was a company promoter,$
+and that he had an interest in a mine, as yet unproved, in Morocco.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is why you were there?‚M-^@M-^] she nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is exactly why,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Unfortunately, right in the$
+midst of the ground which I have either bought or secured mineral rights$
+over, is a block of land which is the property of this man. He is a$
+Spaniard‚M-^@M-^Tdo you speak Spanish?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is precious little!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt matter,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright shook his head. ‚M-^@M-^\He speaks English very$
+well. Now, this land is absolutely valueless to the man, but every$
+attempt I have made to buy it has been unsuccessful, and it is vitally$
+necessary at this moment, when I am floating a company to develop the$
+property, that his claims should be included in my properties.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his name?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] repeated Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\I seem to have heard$
+that name before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is pretty common in France, but not so common in Spain,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr.$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And what am I to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will get you an introduction to him,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys a man$
+with a fine eye for beauty, and in the hands of a clever girl could be$
+wound round her little finger.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see what you mean,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but nothing doing!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have told you that it is necessary for me to$
+acquire this property. I am taking you into my confidence, and I know$
+that you will respect that confidence. I am willing to pay any$
+reasonable sum, and I neither want you to steal it nor make any personal$
+sacrifice to serve my ends. I am willing to pay, and pay heavily.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you call heavily?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl coolly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For the property twenty thousand‚M-^@M-^Tfor you ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^]$
+suggested Cartwright, and the girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys got me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Tell me what your plan is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My plan is this,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\You will appear to Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^TI$
+will arrange that‚M-^@M-^Tas a wealthy young American lady who has been$
+spending the winter in Morocco. His property follows a little wooded$
+hill, one of the prettiest formations of its kind in the Angera country.$
+You must rave about that hill, never cease speaking of its beauty and$
+its attractiveness; and you must tell him that you would give anything$
+in the world if you could build a house amidst that beautiful$
+scenery‚M-^@M-^Tdo you understand me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is a man somewhat susceptible to feminine charms,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright$
+went on, ‚M-^@M-^\and, unless I am greatly mistaken, he will in one of his$
+obliging moods, offer you the land at a nominal figure, particularly as$
+he has been bitterly disappointed in his attempt to find gold.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl after consideration. ‚M-^@M-^\You promised me$
+that if I came to Paris you would get me a job in one of the theatres.$
+That is what I am after, and the only thing I am fit for. The other$
+business doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt seem decent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds!‚M-^@M-^] murmured Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a lot,‚M-^@M-^] agreed the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but how am I coming out of this$
+business? I come out hopelessly compromised.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait a moment,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly; ‚M-^@M-^\let‚M-^@M-^Ys have a clear understanding.$
+You don‚M-^@M-^Yt expect me to walk up to Se√±or Brigot the first time I meet$
+him, or even the second, and say: ‚M-^@M-^XYou‚M-^@M-^Yve a very nice property. What$
+will you sell it for?‚M-^@M-^Y That is not the kind of transaction you expect me$
+to conduct, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means just a little more than you say,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\it means$
+dinners and suppers and hand-holdings and stringing him along. And after$
+it is all over, where am I? I‚M-^@M-^Yve got as much respect for my character as$
+you have for yours, Mr. Mysterious. I want to come out well in this$
+business as you do, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to leave my name behind, or be$
+known in Paris‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the world‚M-^@M-^Tas a decoy duck. I‚M-^@M-^Yd do an awful lot$
+to please you, because I like you and because you‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me.$
+But ‚M-^@M-^Xan awful lot‚M-^@M-^Y does not mean making me so cheap that I am left in$
+the slightly-soiled basket. Do you understand what I mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amazed at the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys cool reasoning. He$
+had not given her credit for any of these fine sentiments she now$
+enunciated, and he was piqued, and at the same time a little pleased.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When you said you‚M-^@M-^Yd give me ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+sounded good. But it is not good enough. I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea in the back of my$
+mind that the matter is a much bigger one for you than you‚M-^@M-^Yve told me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How big do you imagine?‚M-^@M-^] bantered Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think it is big enough to ruin you,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\and that$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yd be willing to pay any price to get this property. Otherwise, you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+go to the man or send your lawyer in the ordinary way. Now, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want$
+your ten thousand pounds, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to make a proposition to you.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve said I like you and that‚M-^@M-^Ys no more than the truth. You told me you$
+were a bachelor and I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you that I‚M-^@M-^Ym man-free and heart-free. I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt say I love you, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt flatter myself that you love me. But$
+if you want this thing to go through, and if you want me to go down in$
+the mud to get it, you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to pay the price‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And the price is‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to marry me,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright could only gasp his admiration; and then he$
+began to laugh, at first quietly, and then, as the humour of the$
+situation gained upon him, so loudly that the other patrons of the Caf√©$
+Scribe turned to look at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a rum idea,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, keeping her eyes on his.$
+$
+He nodded to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a bargain!‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She looked at him as she put out her hand and took his, and slowly shook$
+her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My!‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You want that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys land pretty badly, _I_ know!‚M-^@M-^]$
+and Cartwright began to laugh again.$
+$

+$
+Se√±or Brigot lived in some style for a man who was on the verge of ruin.$
+He had a small house at Maisons Lafitte and a flat on the Boulevard$
+Webber. He was a heavy, tired-looking man, with a dark moustache,$
+obviously dyed, and a short beard, bearing evidence of the same$
+attention. M. Brigot, like Mr. Cartwright, had many interests; but his$
+chief interests were his own tastes and predilections. It was Se√±or$
+Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys boast that, although he had lived for twenty years in Paris, he$
+had never seen Paris between the hours of six in the morning and one in$
+the afternoon. His breakfast hour was two o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. By six o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the$
+evening he was becoming interested in life; and at the hour when most$
+people retire to rest, he was in the prime of his day.$
+$
+It happened on a certain evening that M. Brigot, who usually met dinner$
+in an amicable frame of mind, sat down at his favourite table at the$
+Abbaye with a big frown, and answered the polite _ma√Ætre d‚M-^@M-^Yh√¥tel‚M-^@M-^Ys_$
+cheery ‚M-^@M-^\Good evening‚M-^@M-^] with a snarl.$
+$
+Amongst his many enterprises and few possessions, and this Mr.$
+Cartwright did not know, was the proprietorship and management of a$
+small, ramshackle wooden theatre in the town of Tangier. He was likewise$
+interested in several cabarets throughout Spain. But what pained him$
+most at the moment was not distressing reports from any of these, but a$
+six-page letter received that afternoon from his son, in which the hope$
+of the house of Brigot had explained his reasons for discharging$
+immediately a very necessary servant. Therefore Se√±or Brigot swore under$
+his breath and cursed his first-born.$
+$
+Coincident with the arrival of the letter had come one Jose Ferreira,$
+who had been detained for a week at Madrid. Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys mind was$
+occupied with Jose Ferreira when that worthy, smirking apologetically,$
+as though conscious of the shabbiness of his dress-clothes, sidled into$
+a seat on the opposite side of the table. Se√±or Brigot glared at him a$
+moment, and Jose Ferreira shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had telegraphed to me, I would have settled the matter,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Brigot, as though carrying on a conversation which he had broken off a$
+few minutes before. ‚M-^@M-^\Instead, like the fool you are, you come all the$
+way to Paris, wasting your time in Madrid, and the first I hear of the$
+matter is from my son.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was deplorable,‚M-^@M-^] murmured Jose, ‚M-^@M-^\but Don Brigot‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot!‚M-^@M-^] sneered the father of that worthy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot is a$
+monkey! Why did you take notice of him? Have you nothing else to do in$
+Tangier but to look after that flea-ridden theatre? Have you no other$
+duties?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The young se√±or was emphatic,‚M-^@M-^] murmured the apologetic Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\He$
+demanded that I should leave and what could I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot grunted something uncomplimentary. Whether it was intended for$
+his son or for Ferreira, it was difficult to say. Ferreira was content$
+to take it to himself.$
+$
+Half-way through the dinner Brigot became more human.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will always be quarrels about women, my good Jose, and it is your$
+business to be diplomatic,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\My son is a fool; but then, all$
+young men are fools. Why should you neglect my interests because Emanuel$
+is a bigger fool than ever? Only this week I intended travelling to$
+Tangier with the representative of a very rich syndicate who wishes to$
+buy my land.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same se√±or as before?‚M-^@M-^] asked the interested Jose, who was not only$
+the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, but was also the representative of the$
+rusty little gold-mining company which Brigot had floated.$
+$
+The other nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same cursed Englishman,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Quite unconscious of the fact that his master was cursing the very man$
+whom Jose had most recently cursed, the little man smiled$
+sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I also have a hatred of the English,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\With what insolence do$
+they treat one!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+For some time M. Brigot sat in silence, but presently he wiped his mouth$
+on his napkin, tossed down a tumbler of red wine, and crooked his finger$
+at his companion, inviting closer attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a day, or perhaps two, I shall send you back to Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] began Jose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre‚M-^@M-^Tbah!‚M-^@M-^] exclaimed the other scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\A donkey-driver$
+could look after the theatre! It is the mine!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The mine?‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other in some astonishment.$
+$
+So long had it been since a spade had been put to the ground, so long$
+had those hopes of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys been apparently dead, that the very word$
+‚M-^@M-^\mine‚M-^@M-^] had ceased to be employed when referring to the property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My Englishman will buy it,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot confidently. ‚M-^@M-^\I happen to know$
+that he has taken up property in the neighbourhood, and he has already$
+made me an offer. But such an offer! He shall pay my price, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, nodding as he picked his teeth, ‚M-^@M-^\and it will be a big price,$
+because it is desirable that I should have money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose did not ask the price, but his employer saved him the trouble.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Five million pesetas,‚M-^@M-^] he said confidently; ‚M-^@M-^\for such a price the$
+property will be sold, always providing, my friend, that we do not$
+discover gold before the sale.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose smiled weakly, a circumstance which seemed to annoy his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot irritably; ‚M-^@M-^\you have no brains! You think$
+that is a preposterous sum? Wait!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When his subordinate‚M-^@M-^Ys dinner was finished, Jose was dismissed$
+peremptorily. Brigot had a round of calls to make, a succession of$
+people to be visited; and whilst he might interview the little man at$
+dinner without losing caste, he had no desire to take him round to his$
+usual haunts.$
+$
+It was at the Abbaye at that golden hour when the price of wine soars$
+and all that is smartest in Paris is assembled in the big saloon, that$
+M. Brigot, who had reached a stage of geniality, met an entrancing$
+vision. Brigot saw the girl and her cavalier at one of the tables, and$
+recognised in the latter a well-known man about town. The latter caught$
+his eye and walked across to him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is your charming companion?‚M-^@M-^] whispered Brigot, whose failing was,$
+as Cartwright accurately surmised, a weakness for pretty faces.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is an American lady who has just come from Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+glibly.$
+$
+Cartwright had chosen Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys companion very well. In a few$
+minutes Brigot had crossed to the other table and taken a seat, was$
+introduced, and was in that pleasant glow of mind which comes to the man$
+of his class who is conscious of having made an impression.$
+$
+This ‚M-^@M-^\American widow,‚M-^@M-^] with her queer, broken French, her beautiful$
+eyes, and the charming distinction which goes best with good clothes,$
+was more lovely than any woman he had ever met‚M-^@M-^Tso he swore to himself,$
+as he had sworn before. The friendship progressed from day to day, and$
+so great was the impression which the girl had made, that Brigot was$
+seen abroad at most unusual hours.$
+$
+The patient Jose Ferreira was despatched on a mission to Madrid, partly$
+because Brigot was tired of seeing him hanging about, and partly because$
+there was some genuine business to be done in the capital.$
+$
+Sadie reported progress to her employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, yes, he‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy enough about me,‚M-^@M-^] she said complacently, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going a little crazy myself. How long is this to go on?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another week?‚M-^@M-^] suggested Cartwright, smiling approvingly at the gloom$
+on the pretty face. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you mentioned the fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve taken a$
+fancy to his land?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wanted to give it to me there and then,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but you know$
+what these Spaniards are. If I had accepted, there would have been$
+nothing for me but the front door.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right,‚M-^@M-^] agreed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He is the kind of fish you must play.$
+Did he say anything about other offers he had received for the$
+property?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He spoke about you,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\he called you Benson‚M-^@M-^Tis that your real$
+name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is good enough,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is queer,‚M-^@M-^] mused the girl, looking at him thoughtfully, ‚M-^@M-^\that I$
+never meet any of your friends in Paris, and that nobody knows you‚M-^@M-^Tby$
+name. I went down to your flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+confessed frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\and asked the concierge. You‚M-^@M-^Yre Benson there too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In my business,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary that one should be discreet.$
+The name which goes in London is not good enough for Paris. And _vice$
+versa_,‚M-^@M-^] he added.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a strange man. I suppose if you marry me in the name of Benson$
+it will be legal?‚M-^@M-^] she asked dubiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it will be legal. I‚M-^@M-^Ym surprised at a girl of your$
+intelligence asking such a question,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What is the$
+programme for to-night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled a little face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Marigny and supper at Corbets‚M-^@M-^Tsupper in a private dining-room.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it‚M-^@M-^Ys come to that, has it? Well, you ought to make good to-night,$
+Sadie. Remember, I am willing to pay up to fifty thousand pounds. It is$
+going to be a tough job raising that money, and it will break my heart$
+to pay it. But it will not only break my heart, but it will break me$
+everlastingly and confoundedly to pay the man‚M-^@M-^Ys own price‚M-^@M-^Tand his$
+property must be bought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll do my best,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have no doubt in your mind$
+that it is going to be hard.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+At one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock the next morning he sat reading in his room, when a knock$
+came to his door and the girl came in. She was half hysterical, but the$
+light of triumph was in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it!‚M-^@M-^] he repeated in wonder. ‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean he sold?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For ten thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthree hundred thousand francs. What do you$
+think of your little Sadie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you serious?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+She hesitated and closed her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt talk about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have to see him to-morrow at$
+his lawyers, and the property will be transferred to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She smiled grimly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The after-part will not be as pleasant as M. Brigot imagines,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I tell you, that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy‚M-^@M-^Tstark, staring mad. But I felt$
+an awful beast, and I think he‚M-^@M-^Yll kill me when he discovers I‚M-^@M-^Yve sold$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that worry you,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright easily.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER V$
+$
+$
+HE saw the girl down to her waiting auto, and went back to his rooms$
+to think. It was curious that at that hour, when the big trouble on his$
+mind seemed likely to roll away, that his thoughts flew instantly to$
+Maxell. What would the prim Maxell say, if he knew? He was satisfied$
+that Maxell would not only disapprove, but would instantly and without$
+notice sever all connection with the adventurous company promoter.$
+Maxell would be outraged, appalled. Cartwright smiled at the thought.$
+$
+He was under no illusion as to his own conduct. He knew he was acting$
+despicably; but this view he dismissed from his mind as being too$
+unpleasant for contemplation. Maxell was a prig‚M-^@M-^Ta necessary prig, but$
+none the less priggish. He was necessary, at any rate, to Cartwright.$
+Anyway, Maxell stood to win if the scheme went through.$
+$
+Cartwright had reached nearly the end of his financial tether, and his$
+whole future was bound up in the success or failure of the new$
+promotion. He had exhausted every bit of his credit in order to take up$
+the Angera property which he knew was rich in gold, and offered$
+possibilities which no project of his had offered before.$
+$
+He had milked his other companies dry, he had played with reserves; all$
+except his Anglo-Parisian Finance Company, where the directors were too$
+strong to allow him his own way; and, although Maxell was not aware of$
+the fact, his ‚M-^@M-^\partner‚M-^@M-^] had spent fabulous sums, not only in acquiring$
+the land itself but in purchasing other gold-mining property in the$
+region. It was a gamble, and a dangerous gamble. He was risking the$
+substance of his fortune for the shadow of unlimited wealth.$
+$
+Yet, was it a risk? he asked himself; with the properties that he could$
+include in his new North Morocco Gold Mining Association‚M-^@M-^Tthat was to be$
+the title of the new company‚M-^@M-^Tthere could be no doubt as to the result$
+of the public issue. The British public dearly love a gamble, and a$
+gold-mining gamble, with all its mysteries and uncertainties, more$
+dearly than any.$
+$
+He went to bed late, but was taking his chocolate and roll before a$
+little caf√© on the boulevard before nine. At half-past nine he was$
+joined by the girl.$
+$
+Cartwright had been undecided as to whether he should take his _petit$
+d√©jeuner_ outside or inside the caf√©, and had decided, since the morning$
+was bright and warm, to breakfast under the striped awning in full view$
+of the street. Such great events hang upon slight issues.$
+$
+Scarcely had the girl seated herself opposite to him, when a pedestrian,$
+passing on the other side of the boulevard, halted and stared. Mr.$
+Ferreira had sharp eyes and a wit not altogether dulled by his$
+monotonous occupation.$
+$
+Cartwright produced a bulky package from his pocket and laid it on the$
+table before the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put that in your bag and be careful with it,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\there are three$
+hundred thousand francs in notes. When the property is transferred to$
+you, you must bring the transfer along to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about your promise?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I will keep,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that you have the best$
+guarantee in the possession of the transfer. Legally, it is your$
+property until it is made over to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She sat looking at the package absently, and presently she said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to get me out of Paris at once. Otherwise I am due to leave$
+by the Sud Express‚M-^@M-^Twith Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is a train for Havre at two-fifteen,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He saw her into her car‚M-^@M-^Tanother indiscretion since it brought him out$
+of the shadow which the awning afforded, and gave the observer on the$
+other side of the road an unmistakable view.$
+$
+Brigot was waiting for her‚M-^@M-^Ta heavy-eyed, weary-looking man, whose hand$
+shook whenever it rose to stroke his short, pointed beard.$
+$
+His lawyer watched him curiously as he stepped forward to meet the girl$
+with hands outstretched. It was not the first time that he had seen his$
+client overwhelmed by a pretty face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything is ready, Nanette,‚M-^@M-^] said the eager M. Brigot. (‚M-^@M-^\Nanette‚M-^@M-^] was$
+the newfound name which Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady employed for this adventure.) ‚M-^@M-^\See$
+here, I have all the documents ready!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I have the money,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the girl as she put the package down on$
+the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The money!‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Brigot waved such sordid matters out of existence$
+with a magnificent flourish. ‚M-^@M-^\What is money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Count it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will do no such thing,‚M-^@M-^] said the other extravagantly. ‚M-^@M-^\As a$
+caballero, it hurts me to discuss money in connection‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But his lawyer had no sentiment, and had slipped the string from the$
+package and was now busily counting the thousand-franc notes. When he$
+had finished, he put them on the desk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you one moment, M. Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Brigot, holding the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and devouring her with his eyes, turned$
+impatiently.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The document, my friend, the document! Give me a$
+pen!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is one point in the deed I must discuss,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer firmly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\if mademoiselle will excuse us for a moment‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He opened the door of$
+his inner office invitingly and with a shrug M. Brigot followed him in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have told you, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\that I do not think your$
+action is wise. You are surrendering a property for a sum less than a$
+quarter of what you paid for it to a perfectly unknown woman‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\M. l‚M-^@M-^YAvocat,‚M-^@M-^] said the other gravely, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a lady who$
+to me is more precious than life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer concealed a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have often spoken to you about ladies who have been more precious to$
+you than life,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly, ‚M-^@M-^\but in their cases, no transfer of$
+valuable property was involved. What do you know of this lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know nothing except that she is adorable,‚M-^@M-^] said the reckless$
+Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\But for the fact that, alas! my wife most obstinately refuses$
+to die or divorce me, I should be honoured to make madame my wife. As it$
+is, what a pleasure to give her the land on which to build a beautiful$
+villa overlooking my gorgeous Tangier‚M-^@M-^TI am moving to Tangier very soon$
+to look after my other property‚M-^@M-^Tand to know that her blessed$
+presence‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer spread out despairing hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then there is nothing to be done,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I only tell you that you$
+are transferring a valuable property to a lady who is comparatively$
+unknown to you, and it seems to me a very indiscreet and reckless thing$
+to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They returned again to the outer apartment, where the girl had been$
+standing nervously twisting the moir√© bag in her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is the document, madame,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer to her relief. ‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or$
+Brigot will sign here‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The indicated a line‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and you will sign there. I$
+will cause these signatures to be witnessed, and a copy of the document$
+will be forwarded for registration.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl sat down at the table, and her hand shook as she took up the$
+pen. It was at that moment that Jose Ferreira dashed into the room.$
+$
+He stood open-mouthed at sight of the girl at the table. He tried to$
+speak, but the sound died in his throat. Then he strode forward, under$
+the glaring eye of his employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This woman‚M-^@M-^Tthis woman!‚M-^@M-^] he gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] cried Brigot in a terrible voice, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a$
+lady who is my friend!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Tshe‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthe man pointed to her with shaking finger‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\she is the$
+woman! She escaped! . . . The woman I told you of, who ran away with an$
+Englishman from Tangier!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot stared from one to the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre mad,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is the woman,‚M-^@M-^] squeaked Ferreira, ‚M-^@M-^\and the man also is in Paris. I$
+saw them together this morning at the Caf√© Furnos! The man who was in$
+Tangier, of whom I told the se√±or, and this woman, Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot looked at the girl. She had been caught off her guard, and never$
+once had the keen eyes of the lawyer left her. Given some warning, she$
+might have dissembled and carried the matter through with a high hand.$
+But the suddenness of the accusation, the amazingly unexpected vision of$
+Jose, had thrown her off her guard, and Brigot did not need to look$
+twice at her to know that the charges of his subordinate were justified.$
+She was not a born conspirator, nor was she used to intrigues of this$
+character.$
+$
+Brigot gripped her by the arm and pulled her from the chair. He was half$
+mad with rage and humiliation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the name of this man?‚M-^@M-^] he hissed. ‚M-^@M-^\The name of the man who took$
+you from Tangier and brought you here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was white as death and terribly afraid.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson,‚M-^@M-^] she stammered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer and Brigot uttered the words together, and the Spaniard,$
+releasing his hold stepped back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it was Benson!‚M-^@M-^] he said softly. ‚M-^@M-^\Our wonderful Englishman who wanted$
+to swindle me out of my property, eh? And I suppose he sent you, my$
+beautiful American widow, to purchase land for your villa! Now, you can$
+go back to Mr. Benson and tell him that, if my property is good enough$
+for him to buy, it is good enough for me to keep. You‚M-^@M-^Tyou!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He made a dart at her with upraised hand, but the lawyer was before him$
+and gently pushed him back.$
+$
+He jerked his head to the girl and, shaking like a leaf, she stepped to$
+the door and went stumbling down the stairs, which she had mounted with$
+such confidence a few minutes before.$
+$
+Cartwright received the news with extraordinary equanimity.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has saved us the bother of going out of Paris,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\And it was my own fault. I never connected that infernal$
+fellow Ferreira with Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises. And anyway, we should not$
+have met in public. He said he saw us at the caf√©, did he?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did my best,‚M-^@M-^] she faltered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you did your best,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, patting her hand. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+tough luck, but it can‚M-^@M-^Yt be helped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was a long silence, then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about me?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Where do I come in? I suppose you have$
+no further use for my services?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course I have,‚M-^@M-^] he said genially. Then, after a longer pause, ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know that you‚M-^@M-^Yre the only person in this world that I have ever$
+taken so completely into my confidence and shown what, for a better$
+expression, I will call the seamy side of my business? I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to tell$
+you a lot more, because it would be a relief to me to get it off my$
+chest. But I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling you this, that if I marry you to-day, you‚M-^@M-^Yll have$
+to play your part to save me from everlasting ruin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ruin?‚M-^@M-^] she said, startled, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not the kind of ruin that means you‚M-^@M-^Yll go short of food,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but$
+the sort of ruin that may mean‚M-^@M-^Twell, ruin from my point of view. Now$
+you must understand this thing clearly, Sadie. I‚M-^@M-^Ym out for a big stake,$
+and if I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pull it off, it‚M-^@M-^Ys as likely as not that I‚M-^@M-^Yll go out.$
+You‚M-^@M-^Yre a clever, useful sort of kid, and I have an idea that you may be$
+even more useful. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys to be no sentiment in this marriage, mind!$
+You have just to sit here and hold tight and do as you‚M-^@M-^Yre told, and you$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got to pry into my business any further than I want you to. And$
+if I go away and don‚M-^@M-^Yt come back, you must reckon me as dead. I‚M-^@M-^Yve a lot$
+of business in America and elsewhere, which often takes me away for$
+months at a time, and you‚M-^@M-^Yre not to get uneasy. But if you don‚M-^@M-^Yt hear$
+from me‚M-^@M-^Twhy, you can go down to the Lafayette and buy yourself the$
+grandest little suit of mourning that you can afford!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I be able to afford it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall put some Rentes to your credit at the Lyonnais. That will give$
+you a steady income in case anything happens.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was troubled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite like this idea,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What will happen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Cartwright flicked away the ash from the end of his cigar and said$
+cheerfully:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That depends entirely upon the view which is taken of a certain$
+prospectus issued in London this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER VI$
+$
+$
+THE New Angera Syndicate was registered as a private company, and its$
+prospectus was not made public. Officially, the shares were not offered$
+to general subscription, and actually they had been subscribed‚M-^@M-^Tor the$
+first issue of five hundred thousand had‚M-^@M-^Tby a little group of shrewd$
+speculators in the City of London, who, before now, had made vast sums$
+from Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys promotions. The five hundred thousand shares brought$
+in about half that number of pounds, and nobody doubted that the$
+properties consolidated for the purposes of flotation included the block$
+of claims described in the prospectus as ‚M-^@M-^\lately the property of Se√±or$
+Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Gold had been found on the Angera reef, and gold in sufficient quantity$
+to make the new company a very promising speculation. That Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+property could be made to pay, had it been properly managed, was common$
+knowledge in the City of London. A dozen offers had been made for this$
+concession, but none had been quite acceptable to Se√±or Brigot, whose$
+estimate of the value of the mine varied with the passing hour.$
+$
+Probably, had it been possible to secure an interview with M. Brigot at$
+one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the afternoon, when he arose with a splitting head and a$
+dry throat, his possessions might have been acquired at the price of a$
+quart of sweet champagne.$
+$
+But, as the day progressed and his views of life became more charitable,$
+his estimate expanded until, by seven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the evening, which hour$
+he as a rule reserved for any business discussion, his figure was$
+awe-inspiring. Nobody in the City doubted for one moment that Cartwright$
+had purchased the property. Though his system of finance might not$
+commend itself to the barons and even the baronets of Capel Court, there$
+was no question of his honesty.$
+$
+Was it by some extraordinary fluke that Maxell, who had hitherto shared$
+in the profits of promotion, had kept aloof from this last and greatest$
+of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys flutters? No application for shares was ever found. He$
+heard (he said at a subsequent inquiry) in a round-about way of the$
+flotation, and saw a copy of the prospectus, and was a little worried.$
+He knew that when he had left Cartwright in Paris, not only was the$
+Brigot mine outside of his friend‚M-^@M-^Ys control, but there was precious$
+little prospect of bringing the Spaniard to a reasonable frame of mind.$
+$
+Cartwright must have done his work quickly, he thought, and have paid$
+heavily; and this latter reflection worried him even more because he had$
+a fairly accurate idea as to the condition of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private$
+finances. His private thoughts on this occasion are set forth in the$
+report of the Attorney-General‚M-^@M-^Ys Committee of Investigation.$
+$
+He was eating his solitary dinner in Cavendish Square when the telephone$
+bell rang and the voice of Sir Gregory Fane, the Attorney-General,$
+saluted him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should like to see you, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you come round to$
+Clarges Street after dinner?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Certainly,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell promptly, and hung up the receiver,$
+wondering what new difficulties had arisen, which called for a$
+consultation; for he was not on visiting terms with Mr. Attorney.$
+$
+In the tiny drawing-room of the house occupied by the Cabinet Minister,$
+Maxell was surprised to find another visitor waiting‚M-^@M-^Tno less a person$
+than Fenshaw, the Prime Minister‚M-^@M-^Ys private secretary.$
+$
+The Attorney-General came straight to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\we want your seat in the House of Commons.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The deuce you do!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, raising his eyebrows.$
+$
+The Attorney nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We also want to give you some reward for the excellent services you$
+have rendered to the Government,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But mostly‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This eyes$
+twinkled‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary to find a seat for Sir Milton Boyd‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+Minister of Education has been defeated at a by-election, as you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded. The communication was a surprise to him and he$
+wondered exactly what position was to be offered him which would involve$
+his resignation from the House. For one brief, panicky moment he had$
+connected Cartwright and his delinquencies with this request for an$
+interview, but the Attorney‚M-^@M-^Ys speech had dispelled that momentary fear.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quilland, as you know, has been raised to the Court of Appeal,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the Attorney, speaking of a well-known Chancery Judge, ‚M-^@M-^\and we are$
+departing from our usual practice by bringing over a man from the King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Bench to take his place. Now, Maxell, how does a judgeship appeal to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The K.C. could only stare.$
+$
+Of the many things he did not expect, it was elevation to the Bench,$
+although he was a sound, good lawyer, and the Bench is the ambition of$
+every silk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good!‚M-^@M-^] said the brisk Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\Then we will regard it as settled. The$
+appointment will not be announced for two or three days, so you‚M-^@M-^Yve a$
+chance of clearing up your more urgent work and preparing a letter for$
+your constituents. You might say a kind word for the new candidate who$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt particularly popular in your part of the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+One of Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys first acts was to write a letter to Cartwright. All$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys correspondence went to his London office, and was forwarded$
+under separate cover to Paris. It was a long letter, recapitulating$
+their friendly relationship, and ending:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This promotion, of course, means that we can no longer be$
+    associated in business, and I have instructed my broker to sell$
+    all the shares I possess in your and other companies forthwith.$
+    As you know, I have very definite views about the high prestige$
+    of the Bench; and whilst, in any circumstances, I feel that I$
+    can go to that dignified position with clean hands, my mind will$
+    be freer if I cut all the cords which hold me to commerce of$
+    every shape and description.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Three days later the letter came to Cartwright, and he read it through$
+with a thoughtful expression on his face. He read it twice before he$
+slowly folded it and put it into his inside pocket.$
+$
+Maxell was to be made a Judge!$
+$
+He had never considered that contingency, and did not know whether to be$
+pleased or sorry. He was losing the service of a man who had been a$
+directing force in his life, greater than Maxell himself ever imagined.$
+It was not so much the advice which he asked and received from the$
+King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel, but rather Cartwright had secured help by the simple$
+process of making a study of the other‚M-^@M-^Ys moods and expressions.$
+$
+He knew the half-frown which greeted some schemes, put forward$
+tentatively over the dinner table, and it was that little sign of$
+displeasure which could squash the scheme rather than any considered$
+advice which Maxell might have given. He was losing a good advocate, a$
+very sound legal adviser. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, it did not$
+matter very much. Fate had put a period to an old phase of life, and$
+many things had come to an end coincidently. He was taking his afternoon$
+tea when the letter had arrived, and the new Mrs. Cartwright marked with$
+interest the depression which followed the arrival of the mail.$
+$
+The new period was beginning excitingly, he thought. He had found a new$
+method of doing business, bolder and more desperate than any he had$
+attempted before; and with this development he had lost a man upon whom$
+he placed a great deal of reliance. Incidentally, he had just been$
+married, but this fact did not bulk very largely in his reckoning.$
+Maxell might serve him yet. The memory of an old business$
+partnership‚M-^@M-^Tfor in such an aspect did Cartwright interpret their$
+previous relationship‚M-^@M-^Tthe memory, too, of favours done, of financial$
+dangers shared, might serve him well if things went wrong. Maxell had a$
+pull with the Government‚M-^@M-^Ta greater pull, since he was now a Judge of$
+the Supreme Court.$
+$
+Maxell a Judge! It seemed queer. Cartwright had all the properly$
+constituted Englishman‚M-^@M-^Ys reverence for the Bench. In spite of much$
+experience in litigation, and an acquaintance with lawyers of all kinds$
+and stations, he reserved his awe for the god-like creature who sat in$
+wig and gown, and dispensed justice evenhandedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you had a worrying letter?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said, a little impatiently; ‚M-^@M-^\it is nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She had hoped for a glimpse of the envelope, but was disappointed.$
+Curiously enough, she ascribed the fact that her husband passed under a$
+strange name and would not divulge his own, to a cause which was far$
+from the truth, and was a great injustice to a man who, if he had not$
+given her his proper name, had given her a title to whatever name he$
+had. That thought she revealed for the first time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know what I think?‚M-^@M-^] she said unexpectedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you thought very much,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\In what particular$
+department of speculation does your mind wander?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] she answered. She was a little afraid of sarcasm,$
+as are all children and immature grown-ups. ‚M-^@M-^\It was about your name I$
+was thinking.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why the dickens don‚M-^@M-^Yt you leave my name alone?‚M-^@M-^] he snapped. ‚M-^@M-^\I have$
+told you that it is all for your good that I‚M-^@M-^Ym called Benson and known$
+as Benson in this town. When we go to London you will discover my name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know why you keep it dark.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why do I keep it dark?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, fixing his eyes on her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre married already.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her for a moment, and then burst into such a peal of$
+laughter that the girl knew her shot was wide of the mark.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a weird person,‚M-^@M-^] he said, getting up. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going out to see an$
+old friend of ours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of ours?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is the gentleman‚M-^@M-^Ys name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He won‚M-^@M-^Yt see you,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, won‚M-^@M-^Yt he?‚M-^@M-^] said the grim man. ‚M-^@M-^\I rather think he will.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot would not willingly have received one whose name was anathema,$
+but Cartwright got over the difficulty of his reception by the simple$
+process of sending up a card inscribed with the name of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys lawyer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You!‚M-^@M-^] spluttered M. Brigot, rising to his feet as the other entered the$
+room and closed the door behind him. ‚M-^@M-^\This is an outrage! It is$
+monstrous! You will leave this house immediately, or I will send for the$
+police!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, just keep quiet for a moment, Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, seating$
+himself coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see you as one business man to another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I refuse to discuss any business with you,‚M-^@M-^] stormed his unwilling host.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a scoundrel, a conspirator‚M-^@M-^Tbah! why do I talk to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre broke!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in calm, level tones, and he$
+used the Spanish word for ‚M-^@M-^\broke,‚M-^@M-^] which is so much more expressive than$
+any word in English.$
+$
+The conversation was carried on in this language, for Cartwright had an$
+intimate knowledge of its idioms and even of its patois.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your creditors in Paris are gathering round like hawks about a dead$
+cow. Your attempt to sell your Moorish property has been a failure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know a great deal,‚M-^@M-^] sneered Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Possibly you also know that I$
+am going to work the mine myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard that said of you for years,‚M-^@M-^] said he, ‚M-^@M-^\but the truth is,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre wholly incapable of working anything. You‚M-^@M-^Yre one of nature‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+little spenders‚M-^@M-^Tnow, Brigot, don‚M-^@M-^Yt let us quarrel. There is a time to$
+end feuds like ours, and this is that time. I am a business man, and so$
+are you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre as anxious to sell your property at a good price as I am$
+to buy it. I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to make you an offer.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot laughed sarcastically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded with gentle irony. ‚M-^@M-^\To build a house$
+for a beautiful American widow, eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright accepted the gibe with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to show you my hand,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will be infamously dirty,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot, who was in his bright six$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock mood.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know there is gold in the Angera,‚M-^@M-^] the other went on, without$
+troubling to notice the interruption, ‚M-^@M-^\and I know that, properly worked,$
+your mine may pay big profits.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will sell out,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot after consideration, ‚M-^@M-^\but at a price.$
+I have told you before I will sell out‚M-^@M-^Tat a price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But what a price!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, raising his eyebrows and with a$
+gesture of extravagant despair. ‚M-^@M-^\It is all the money in the world!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nevertheless, it is the price,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot comfortably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you what I am willing to do.‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright stroked his chin as$
+though the solution had just occurred to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I will float your$
+property in London, tacking on a number of other properties which I have$
+bought in the neighbourhood. I am willing to pay you two hundred$
+thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, six million francs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot was interested. He was so interested that, for the moment, he$
+could forget his animosity and private grievances. It was true that, as$
+Cartwright had said, his creditors were becoming noisy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In cash, of course?‚M-^@M-^] he said suddenly.$
+$
+Cartwright shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can have a portion in cash and the rest in shares.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] Brigot snapped his fingers. ‚M-^@M-^\I also can issue shares, my friend.$
+What are shares? Pieces of paper which are not worth their ink. No, no,$
+you deceive me. I thought you had come to me with a genuine offer. There$
+is no business to be done between you and me, Mr. Cartwright. Good$
+evening.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not move.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A portion in cash‚M-^@M-^Tsay, fifteen thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he suggested; ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+is a lot of money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To you‚M-^@M-^Tyes, but not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said the magnificent Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Give me$
+two-thirds in cash and I will take the rest in shares. That is my last$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This offer is open until‚M-^@M-^Twhen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Until to-morrow at this hour,‚M-^@M-^] replied Brigot.$
+$
+As Cartwright was going, a man tapped at the door. It was Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+‚M-^@M-^\secretary,‚M-^@M-^] who was also his valet. He handed a telegram to the$
+Spaniard, and Brigot opened and read. He was a long time digesting its$
+contents, and Cartwright waited for a favourable opportunity to say$
+good-bye. All the time his mind was working, and he thought he saw$
+daylight. Two-thirds of the money could be raised, and he could breathe$
+again.$
+$
+Presently Brigot folded up the telegram and put it in his pocket, and$
+there was on his face a beatific smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good night, Se√±or Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I will see you to-morrow$
+with the money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will have to be big money, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot, and there was a$
+note of exultation in his voice. ‚M-^@M-^\To buy my little property will cost$
+you half a million English pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know Solomon Brothers, the financiers of London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know them very well,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright steadily. He had good reason$
+to know Solomon Brothers, who had taken a large block of shares in his$
+new syndicate.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just had a telegram from Solomon Brothers,‚M-^@M-^] said Se√±or Brigot,$
+speaking slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and they ask me to give them the date when my property$
+was transferred to your syndicate. They tell me it is included in your$
+properties which you have floated. You know best, Mr. Cartwright,$
+whether my little mine is worth half a million English pounds to$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tespecially if I put a date agreeable to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blackmail, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright between his teeth, and without a word$
+left the room.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VII$
+$
+$
+HE went straight back to his flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army, and$
+the girl could see by his face that something had happened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might pack my bag, will you?‚M-^@M-^] he said almost brusquely. ‚M-^@M-^\I have a$
+letter or two to write. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to London. Important business has$
+arisen, and I may be gone some time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Wisely she asked no questions, but carried out his instructions. When$
+she came back from the room with a little gripsack packed, he was$
+blotting the envelope of the last letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Post these after I have gone,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I come down to the station and see you off?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The less you and I are seen together, the better, I think,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+with a faint smile.$
+$
+He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a cash-box. From this he$
+extracted a thick wad of notes, and, counting them rapidly, he tossed a$
+respectable bundle into her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may want this,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you have a regular income, but$
+you must keep in touch with the Lyonnais. For the moment I should advise$
+you to go to‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The looked at the ceiling for inspiration‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to Nice or$
+Monte Carlo. Keep away from the tables,‚M-^@M-^] he added humorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But‚M-^@M-^Tbut,‚M-^@M-^] said the bewildered girl, ‚M-^@M-^\for how long will you be gone?$
+Can‚M-^@M-^Yt I come with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is impossible,‚M-^@M-^] he said sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\You must go to the South of$
+France, leave by to-night‚M-^@M-^Ys train. Give your address to nobody, and take$
+another name if necessary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are things very wrong?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pretty bad,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry. I may be gone for a year, even$
+more. There are plenty of things you can do, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt go back into the$
+profession yet awhile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of taking up cinema work,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might do worse than go to America‚M-^@M-^Tif I am a long time gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stuffed the remainder of the notes into his pocket, picked up his$
+bag, and with no other farewell than a curt nod, left her.$
+$
+She was only to see him once again in her life-time.$
+$
+He crossed the Channel by the night boat and came to London in the early$
+hours of the morning. He drove straight away to his hotel, had a bath$
+and shaved. His plan was fairly well formed. Everything depended upon$
+the charity which Messrs. Solomon Brothers might display towards his$
+strange lapse.$
+$
+At breakfast he read in _The Times_ that ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Justice Maxell took his$
+seat upon the Bench‚M-^@M-^] on the previous day, and that paragraph, for some$
+reason, seemed to cheer him.$
+$
+At ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock he was in the City. At half-past ten he was interviewing$
+the senior partner of Solomon Brothers, a man with an expressionless$
+face, who listened courteously to the somewhat lame excuses which$
+Cartwright offered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was a mistake of a blundering clerk,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\As$
+soon as I discovered the error, I came back to London to withdraw all$
+the money which had been subscribed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a pity you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt come back yesterday, Mr. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Solomon.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\that we have already placed this matter in$
+the hands of our solicitors. I suggest that you had better interview$
+them.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright made a further pilgrimage to the solicitors of Solomon$
+Brothers, and found them most unwilling to see him. That was an ominous$
+sign, and he went back to his office in Victoria Street conscious that a$
+crisis was at hand. At any rate, the girl was out of the way; but, what$
+was more important, she, one of the principal witnesses in so far as$
+Brigot and his property were concerned, was not available for those who$
+might bring a charge against him. She was his wife, and her lips were$
+sealed, and this consequence of his marriage was one which he had not$
+wholly overlooked when he had contracted his strange alliance.$
+$
+What a fool he had been! The property might have been transferred and in$
+his hands, if he had not antagonised a wretched little Spanish$
+theatrical manager. But, he reflected, if he had not antagonised that$
+manager, he would not have possessed the instrument for extracting the$
+transfer from the amorous Brigot.$
+$
+At the top of a heap of letters awaiting him was one written in a firm$
+boyish hand, and Cartwright made a little grimace, as though for the$
+first time recognising his responsibility.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson; my lad, you will have to take a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and pushed the letter aside unopened.$
+$
+He lunched at his club, sent a brief letter to Maxell, and returned to$
+his office at two in the afternoon. His clerk told him that a man was$
+waiting for him in the inner office. Cartwright hesitated with his hand$
+on the door; then, setting his teeth, he stepped in.$
+$
+The stranger rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you Mr. Alfred Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is my name,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am Inspector Guilbury, of the City Police,‚M-^@M-^] said the stranger, ‚M-^@M-^\and I$
+shall take you into custody on charges under the Companies Act, and a$
+further charge of conspiracy to defraud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go ahead,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+All the week preceding the trial, Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys heart was filled with$
+warm, gratitude to his erstwhile friend. He did not doubt, when his$
+solicitor told him that Mr. Justice Maxell would try his case, that$
+Maxell had gone a long way out of his way to get himself appointed the$
+Old Bailey judge. How like Maxell it was‚M-^@M-^Tthat queer, solemn stick‚M-^@M-^Tand$
+how loyal!$
+$
+Cartwright had a feeling for Maxell which he had never had before. At$
+first he had feared the embarrassment which might be Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys at having$
+to try a case in which an old friend was implicated, and had even hoped$
+that the new judge would have nothing to do with the trial. He did not$
+despair of Maxell pulling strings on his behalf, and he realised that$
+much could be done by judicious lobbying.$
+$
+The charge against him was a grave one. He had not realised how serious$
+it was until he had seen that respectful array of counsel in the Lord$
+Mayor‚M-^@M-^Ys Court, and had heard his misdemeanours reduced to cold legal$
+phraseology. But he did not wholly despair. Brigot had been coming to$
+London to give evidence, and on his journey there had occurred an$
+incident which suggested to the accused man that Providence was fighting$
+on his side. The Spaniard had had a stroke in the train to Calais, and$
+the doctors reported that he might not recover. Not that Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+evidence was indispensable. There was, apparently, a letter and two$
+telegrams in existence, in the course of which Brigot denied that he had$
+ever parted with his property; and the onus lay upon Cartwright to prove$
+that he had acted in a _bona fide_ manner‚M-^@M-^Tthat was impossible of proof,$
+and nobody knew this better than Cartwright.$
+$
+And ever his mind reverted to the singular act of generosity on the part$
+of his old friend. He did not doubt for one moment that Maxell had$
+‚M-^@M-^\worked‚M-^@M-^] the case so that it fell to him to try it.$
+$
+It was a bright morning in May when he came up the steps of the Old$
+Bailey and took his place in the dock. Almost immediately after, the$
+Judge and the Sheriff entered from the door behind the plain oaken$
+bench. How well the judicial robes became Maxell, thought Cartwright. He$
+bowed slightly and received as slight a bow in reply. Maxell was looking$
+pale. His face was drawn, and there was resolution in his speech and in$
+his eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before this case proceeds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I wish to direct attention to a$
+statement in one of the newspapers this morning, that I was associated$
+with the accused in business, and that I am in some way involved,$
+directly or indirectly, in the company promotion‚M-^@M-^Teither as a$
+shareholder or an indirect promoter‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the subject of the present$
+charge. I wish to utter an emphatic denial to that statement.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He spoke clearly and slowly and looked the prisoner straight in the eye,$
+and Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can only endorse your lordship‚M-^@M-^Ys statement,‚M-^@M-^] he said emphatically.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your lordship has never had any dealings with me or any business$
+transactions whatsoever.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a minor sensation which provided a headline for the evening$
+newspapers. The case proceeded. It was not particularly involved and the$
+witnesses were few but vital. There were those business men who had$
+subscribed or promised to subscribe to the syndicate. There was Mr.$
+Solomon, who could give an account of his dealings with the prisoner.$
+But, most damning of all, was a sworn statement made by Brigot before an$
+English solicitor, a Commissioner of Oaths. And it was such a statement$
+which only documentary proof, produced by the accused man, could refute.$
+$
+Cartwright listened to the evidence untroubled of mind. He knew that his$
+counsel‚M-^@M-^Ys speech, delivered with such force, was little less than an$
+admission of guilt and a plea for mercy. The last word would be with the$
+judge. A verdict of ‚M-^@M-^\guilty‚M-^@M-^] there must necessarily be. But he thought$
+that, when later his counsel pleaded for a minimum sentence, he saw a$
+responsive look in the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+The stigma of imprisonment did not greatly distress Cartwright. He had$
+lived on the narrow border-line of illegalities too long; he had weighed$
+chances and penalties too nicely to bother about such ephemeral things$
+as ‚M-^@M-^\honour.‚M-^@M-^] His system of finance was reviewed, and certain minor$
+charges arising out of the manipulation of funds were gone into. It was$
+late in the evening when the Judge began his summing up.$
+$
+It was a fair, if a conventional address he delivered to the jury.$
+Obviously, thought Cartwright, he could do nothing less than call$
+attention to the serious nature of the charge, the interests involved,$
+the betrayal of shareholders, and the like. On the whole, the summing up$
+did not diminish the comforting sense that the worst that lay before him$
+was a few months‚M-^@M-^Y imprisonment and then a start in another land under$
+another name. He never doubted his ability to make money. The summing up$
+was ended, and the jury retired. They were gone twenty minutes, and when$
+they came back it was a foregone conclusion what their verdict would be.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Guilty,‚M-^@M-^] was the reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And is that the verdict of you all?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Justice Maxell was examining his notes, and presently he closed the$
+little book which he was consulting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The charge against Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is one of the most$
+serious which could be brought against a business man. The jury have$
+returned a verdict of guilty, and I must say that I concur in that$
+verdict. I am here in my place‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This voice shook a little‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to$
+administer and maintain the laws of England. I must do all that in me is$
+possible to preserve the purity of commercial life and the condition of$
+English commercial honesty.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright waited for that ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tit did not come.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In view of the seriousness of the frauds and irregularities which the$
+accused has committed, with a cynical disregard for the happiness or$
+fortune of those people whose interests should have been his own, I$
+cannot do less than pass a sentence which will serve as an example to$
+all wrongdoers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped and gripped the edge of the dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You, Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, and again looked him straight in$
+the eye, ‚M-^@M-^\will be kept in penal servitude for twenty years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright swallowed something. Then he leaned across the edge of the$
+dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You swine!‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily, and then the warders dragged him away.$
+$
+Two days later there was a new sensation. The newspapers announced that$
+Mr. Justice Maxell had been compelled, on account of ill-health, to$
+resign from the Bench, and that His Majesty had been pleased to confer a$
+baronetcy of the United Kingdom upon the ex-Judge.$
+$

+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VIII$
+$
+$
+SOME nine years after the events detailed in the last chapter, a$
+fairly clever young actress who had drifted into the cinematograph$
+business, faced one of the many disappointments which had made up her$
+life. In many ways the disappointment was more bitter than any she had$
+previously experienced, because she had banked so heavily upon success.$
+$
+If there was any satisfaction to be had out of the new tragedy it was to$
+be found in the fact that the fault was not entirely hers. An impartial$
+critic might, indeed, absolve her from all responsibility.$
+$
+In this particular instance she regarded herself in the light of a$
+martyr to indifferent literature‚M-^@M-^Tnot without reason.$
+$
+When the Westminster Art Film Company was tottering on its last legs,$
+Mr. Willie Ellsberger, chairman and chief victim, decided on one big$
+throw for fortune. The play decided upon does not matter, because it was$
+written by Willie himself, with the assistance of his advertising man,$
+but it contained all the stunts that had ever got by in all the photo$
+plays that had ever been produced, and in and out of every breathless$
+situation flashed Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, the most amazing, the most charming,$
+the most romantic, the highest salaried artiste that filmland had ever$
+known.$
+$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had come to London from Honolulu, after she had inherited$
+her father‚M-^@M-^Ys considerable fortune. She came, a curious visitor, to the$
+studios, merely as a spectator, and had laughingly refused Mr.$
+Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys first offer, that gentleman having been attracted by her$
+perfect face and the grace of her movements; but at last, after$
+extraordinary persuasion, she had agreed to star in that stupendous$
+production, ‚M-^@M-^\The Soul of Babylon,‚M-^@M-^] for a fee of ¬£25,000, which was to be$
+distributed amongst certain Honolulu charities in which she was$
+interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] she told a newspaper man, ‚M-^@M-^\this is to be my first and my last$
+film. I enjoy the work very much, but naturally it takes up a great deal$
+of my time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you returning to Honolulu?‚M-^@M-^] asked our representative.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] replied Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, ‚M-^@M-^\I am going on to Paris. My agent has bought$
+me the Duc de Montpelier‚M-^@M-^Ys house in the Avenue d‚M-^@M-^YEtoile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A week after the picture was finished, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady waited on the$
+chairman by appointment.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] said that gentleman, leaning back in his chair, and$
+smiling unhappily, ‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a flivver!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We ran it off for the big renter from the North, and he says it is$
+about as bad as it can be, and that all the good in it is so obviously$
+stolen, that he dare not risk the injunction which would follow the$
+first exhibition. Did Simmonds pay you your last week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, Mr. Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Ellsberger shrugged.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sets me back another twenty pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said and reached for his$
+cheque-book. ‚M-^@M-^\It is tough on you, Sadie, but it‚M-^@M-^Ys tougher on us. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+so sure that it is so tough on you, though. I spent a fortune$
+advertising you. There isn‚M-^@M-^Yt anybody in this country who hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt heard of$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and,‚M-^@M-^] he added grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yve more publicity than I hope$
+I shall get when this business goes into the hands of the Official$
+Receiver.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So there‚M-^@M-^Ys no more work?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl after a pause.$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys hands said: ‚M-^@M-^\What can I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You ought not to have any difficulty in getting a shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\with$
+your figure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Especially when the figure‚M-^@M-^Ys twenty pounds a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+unsmilingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I was a fool ever to leave Paris. I was doing well there$
+and I wish I‚M-^@M-^Yd never heard of the cinema business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Still young and pretty and slim, with a straight nose and a straighter$
+mouth, she had no appeal for Mr. Ellsberger, who in matters of business$
+had an unsympathetic nature.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you go back to Paris?‚M-^@M-^] he said, speaking very deliberately$
+and looking out of the window. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps that affair has blown over by$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What affair?‚M-^@M-^] she asked sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve friends in Paris,‚M-^@M-^] said the chairman, ‚M-^@M-^\good, bright boys who go$
+around a lot, and they know most of what‚M-^@M-^Ys going on in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, biting her lips thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Reggie van Rhyn‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble you heard about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what happened, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll never believe in a thousand years$
+that I stabbed him,‚M-^@M-^] she said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been too much of$
+a lady for that sort of thing‚M-^@M-^TI was educated at a convent.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger yawned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take that to Curtis, will you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\If he can get any free$
+publicity for you, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yll be glad. Now take my advice‚M-^@M-^Tstay on. I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+put Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady way up amongst the well-known products of Movieland,$
+and you‚M-^@M-^Yll be a fool if you quit just when the public is getting$
+interested in you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym in bad, but that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt affect you, Sadie, and$
+there ain‚M-^@M-^Yt a producer in England who wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt jump at you and give you$
+twice the salary I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She stood up, undecided. Ellsberger was growing weary of the interview.$
+He made a great show of pulling out notepaper and rang the bell for his$
+stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The publicity‚M-^@M-^Ys fine,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yve felt good about the$
+work. Why the letters that I‚M-^@M-^Yve had from people asking for my autograph$
+and pictures of my Honolulu estate‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe smiled a little$
+frostily‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\people in society, too. Why, a titled man who wrote to me$
+from Bournemouth, Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger was interested, indeed, he was fascinated. He waved away$
+his stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre sure it was Maxell? Sir John$
+Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys class there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And there‚M-^@M-^Ys money, too,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+get in touch with him, Sadie? A fellow like that would think nothing of$
+putting ten thousand into a picture if he was interested in a girl. If$
+you happen to be the girl, Sadie, there‚M-^@M-^Yll be a thousand pound contract$
+for you right away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Her straight lips were a trifle hard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you want is an angel, and the Judge is the best kind of angel you$
+could wish for.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has he got money?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] said the hands of Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\What a ridiculous question to$
+ask!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] he scoffed. ‚M-^@M-^\Money to burn. Do you mean to say you‚M-^@M-^Yve never$
+heard of Sir John Maxell, never heard of the man who sent his best$
+friend to gaol for twenty years? Why, it was the biggest sensation of$
+the year!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sadie was not very interested in history, but momentarily, by virtue of$
+the very warm and well punctuated letter which reposed in her bag, she$
+was interested in Sir John.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is he married?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl naturally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is not married,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger emphatically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Any children?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no children, but he has a niece‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got some legal$
+responsibility as regards her; I remember seeing it in the newspapers,$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys her guardian or something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger looked at the girl with a speculative eye.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you his letter?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded and produced the epistle.$
+$
+It was polite but warm. It had some reference to her ‚M-^@M-^\gracious talent,‚M-^@M-^]$
+to her ‚M-^@M-^\unexampled beauty‚M-^@M-^] which had ‚M-^@M-^\brought pleasure to one who was no$
+longer influenced by the commonplace,‚M-^@M-^] and it finished up by expressing$
+the hope that they two would meet in the early future, and that before$
+leaving for Paris she would honour him by being his guest for a few$
+days.$
+$
+Ellsberger handed the letter back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Write him,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and, Sadie, consider yourself engaged for another$
+week‚M-^@M-^Twrite to him in my time. He‚M-^@M-^Ys fallen for all that Press stuff, and$
+maybe, if he‚M-^@M-^Ys got that passionate admiration for your genius$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll‚M-^@M-^Tsay, you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to stay in the picture business and finish by$
+marrying that kind of trouble, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pointed through the wide windows to a youth who was coming across$
+from the studio to the office, swinging a cane vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Observe the lavender socks and the wrist watch,‚M-^@M-^] he chuckled. ‚M-^@M-^\But$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt make any mistake about Timothy Anderson. He‚M-^@M-^Ys the toughest amateur$
+at his weight in this or any other state and a good boy, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+kind of fellow that women like you marry‚M-^@M-^Tget acquainted with the$
+Judge.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+With only a preliminary knock, which he did not wait to hear answered,$
+the young man had swung through the door, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do, Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I saw your picture‚M-^@M-^Tfine! Good acting,$
+but a perfectly rotten play. I suppose you wrote it, Ellsberger?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wrote it,‚M-^@M-^] admitted that gentleman gloomily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It bears the impression of your genius, old bird.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson shook his head reproachfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It only wanted you as the leading man, and it would have been dead$
+before we put the titles in,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger with a grin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of the movies for good,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy Anderson, sitting himself$
+on a table. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a demoralising occupation‚M-^@M-^Twhich reminds me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped from the table, thrust his hand into his pocket, and$
+producing a roll of notes:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I owe you twenty-five pounds, Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Thank you very$
+much. You saved me from ruin and starvation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He counted the money across, and Mr. Ellsberger was undoubtedly$
+surprised and made no attempt to conceal the fact. So surprised was he$
+that he could be jocose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Fixed a big contract with Mary Pickford?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\N-no,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I struck a roulette game‚M-^@M-^Tand took a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Took a chance again, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\One of these days you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+take a chance and never get better of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pooh!‚M-^@M-^] said the other in derision. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you think that‚M-^@M-^Ys any new$
+experience for me? Not on your life. I went into this game with just$
+twelve pounds and my hotel bill three weeks in arrears. I was down to my$
+last half-crown, but I played it and came out with three hundred$
+pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Whose game was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Ellsberger curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tony Smail,‚M-^@M-^] and Mr. Ellsberger whistled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, that‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the toughest places in town,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a$
+wonder you came away with the money‚M-^@M-^Tand your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I took a chance,‚M-^@M-^] said the other carelessly, and swung his legs once$
+more over the edge of the desk. ‚M-^@M-^\There was some slight trouble when I$
+came out of Smail‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] he shrugged his shoulders, ‚M-^@M-^\just a little$
+horseplay.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had followed the conversation keenly. Any talk which circled$
+about finance had the effect of concentrating her attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you always take a chance?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Always,‚M-^@M-^] said the other promptly.$
+$
+This woman did not appeal to him. Timothy possessed a seventh sense$
+which he called his ‚M-^@M-^\Sorter,‚M-^@M-^] and Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady was already sorted$
+into the heap of folks who, had life been a veritable voyage, would have$
+been labelled ‚M-^@M-^\Not Wanted.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going by the next boat to New York,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\then I‚M-^@M-^Yll go to$
+California. Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll take in Kempton on my way, for a fellow I met at$
+the hotel has a horse running which can catch pigeons. Good-bye, Miss$
+O‚M-^@M-^YGrady. I wish you every kind of luck.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She watched him disappear, sensing his antagonism and responding$
+thereto. If he could judge women by intuition, she judged him by reason,$
+and she knew that here was a man whose mental attitude was one of$
+dormant hostility.$
+$
+It would be unfair to her to say that it was because she recognised the$
+clean mind and the healthy outlook and the high principles of this young$
+man that she disliked him. She was not wholly bad, because she had been$
+the victim of circumstances and had lately lived a two-thousand pound$
+life on a one-hundred pound capacity. She looked after him, biting her$
+lips as though she were solving a great problem.$
+$
+Presently she turned to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll write to Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+By a curious coincidence Timothy Anderson had the idea of approaching$
+Sir John Maxell also, though nearly a year passed before he carried his$
+idea into execution.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER IX$
+$
+$
+THE initials ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] before young Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood for$
+Timothy Alfred Cartwright, his pious but practical parent having, by$
+this combination, made a bid for the protection of the saints and the$
+patronage of Cousin Al Cartwright, reputedly a millionaire and a$
+bachelor. It was hoped in this manner that his position on earth and in$
+heaven would be equally secure.$
+$
+What Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chances are in the hereafter the reader must decide; but$
+we do know that Cousin Al Cartwright proved both a weak reed and a$
+whited sepulchre. Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys parents had departed this life two years$
+after Alfred Cartwright had disappeared from public view, leaving behind$
+him two years‚M-^@M-^Y work for a committee of Investigating Accounts.$
+$
+When his surviving parent died, the boy was at school, and if he was not$
+a prodigy of learning he was at least brilliant in parts.$
+$
+Though it was with no great regret that he left school, he was old$
+enough and shrewd enough to realise that a bowing acquaintance with the$
+differential calculus, and the ability to conjugate the verb ‚M-^@M-^\avoir‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute an equipment, sufficiently comprehensive (if you will$
+forgive these long words), to meet and defeat such enemies to human$
+progress as he was likely to meet in this cruel and unsympathetic world.$
+$
+He had a small income bequeathed by his mother in a will which was$
+almost apologetic because she left so little, and he settled himself$
+down as a boarder in the house of a schoolmaster, and took up those$
+branches of study which interested him, and set himself to forget other$
+branches of education which interested him not at all.$
+$
+Because of his ineradicable passion for challenging fate it was only$
+natural that ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] should bear a new significance, and since some$
+genius had christened him ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson the name stuck. And$
+he took chances. From every throw with fate he learnt something. He had$
+acquired some knowledge of boxing at school, and had learnt enough of$
+the art to enable him to head the school. Such was his faith in himself$
+and his persuasive eloquence that he induced Sam Murphy,$
+ex-middle-weight and proprietor of the Stag‚M-^@M-^Ys Head, Dorking, to nominate$
+and support him for a ten-rounds contest with that redoubtable$
+feather-weight, Bill Schenk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson took his chance. He also took the count in the$
+first round, and, returning to consciousness, vowed a vow‚M-^@M-^Tnot that he$
+would never again enter the ring, but that he would learn something more$
+of the game before he did. Of course, it was very disgraceful that a man$
+of his antecedents should become a professional boxer‚M-^@M-^Tfor professional$
+he became in the very act of failure‚M-^@M-^Tbut that worried him not at all.$
+$
+It is a matter of history that Bill Schenk was knocked out by Kid$
+Muldoon, and that twelve months after his initiation into the prize ring$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. Anderson‚M-^@M-^] fought twenty rounds with the Kid and got the decision on$
+points. Thereafter, the ring knew ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson no more.$
+$
+He took a chance on race-courses, backing horses that opened at tens and$
+closed at twenties. He backed horses that had never won before on the$
+assumption that they must win some time. He had sufficient money left$
+after this adventure to buy a book of form. He devoted his undoubted$
+talent to the study of other games of chance. He played cards for$
+matches with a broker‚M-^@M-^Ys clerk, who harboured secret ambitions of going$
+to Monte Carlo with a system; he purchased on the hire system$
+wonderfully cheap properties on the Isle of Thanet‚M-^@M-^Tand he worked.$
+$
+For all his fooling and experimenting, for all his gambling and his$
+chancing, Timothy never let a job of work get past him, if he could do$
+it, and when he wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt working for sordid lucre he was working for the$
+good of his soul. He went to the races with a volume of Moli√®re‚M-^@M-^Ys plays$
+under his arm, and between events he read, hereby acquiring the respect$
+of the racing fraternity as an earnest student of form.$
+$
+So he came by violent, yet to him easy, stages to Movieland‚M-^@M-^Tthat Mecca$
+which attracts all that is enterprising and romantic and restless. He$
+took a chance in a juvenile lead, but his method and his style of$
+actions were original. Producers are for ever on the look out for$
+novelty, but they put the bar up against novel styles of acting and$
+expression. Ellsberger had tried him out because he had known his$
+father, but more because he had won money over him when he had beaten$
+Kid Muldoon; but even Ellsberger was compelled to suggest that Timothy$
+put in two long years ‚M-^@M-^\atmosphering‚M-^@M-^] before he essayed an individual$
+r√¥le on the screen.$
+$
+Timothy was not certain whether his train left at ten minutes to seven$
+or at ten minutes past seven, so he arrived in time for the ten minutes$
+to seven, which was characteristic of him, because he never took a$
+chance against the inflexible systems.$
+$
+He reached New York without misadventure, but on his way westward he$
+stayed over at Nevada. He intended spending a night, but met a man with$
+a scheme for running a mail-order business on entirely new lines,$
+invested his money, and by some miracle managed to make it last a year.$
+At the end of that time the police were after his partner, and Timothy$
+was travelling eastward by easy stages.$
+$
+He came back to New York with fifty-five dollars which he had won from a$
+Westerner on the last stage of the journey. The track ran for about$
+twenty miles along the side of the road, the wager between them was a$
+very simple one; it was whether they would pass more men than women on$
+the road. The Westerner chose men and Timothy chose women. For every man$
+they saw Timothy paid a dollar, for every woman he received a dollar. In$
+the agreed hour they passed fifty-five more women than they passed men$
+and Timothy was that many dollars richer. There were never so many women$
+abroad as there were that bright afternoon, and the Westerner couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+understand it until he realised that it was Sunday‚M-^@M-^Ta fact which Timothy$
+had grasped before he had made his wager.$
+$
+Two months later he was back in London. How he got back he never$
+explained. He stayed in London only long enough to fit himself up with a$
+new kit before he presented himself at a solid mansion in Branksome$
+Park, Bournemouth. Years and years before, Sir John Maxell had written$
+to him, asking him to call upon him for any help he might require, and$
+promising to assist him in whatever difficulties he might find himself.$
+Timothy associated the offer with the death of his father‚M-^@M-^Tmaybe they$
+were friends.$
+$
+He was shown into the sunny drawing-room bright with flowers, and he$
+looked round approvingly. He had lived in other people‚M-^@M-^Ys houses all his$
+life‚M-^@M-^Tschools, boarding-houses, hotels and the like‚M-^@M-^Tand an atmosphere$
+of home came to him like the forgotten fragrance of a garden he had$
+known.$
+$
+The servant came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will see you in ten minutes, sir, but you must not keep him$
+long, because he has to go out to meet Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in surprise, ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know he was$
+married.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant smiled and said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Judge married a year ago, sir. It was in all the newspapers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt read all the newspapers,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt sufficient$
+time. Who was the lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man looked round, as if fearing to be overheard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John married the cinema lady, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and the$
+hostility in his tone was unmistakable.$
+$
+Timothy gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, that beats the band! Why, I knew that$
+da‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T, that lady in London!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant inclined his head sideways.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Indeed, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and it was evident that he did not regard$
+Timothy as being any fitter for human association by reason of his$
+confession.$
+$
+A distant bell buzzed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John is ready, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I hope you will not mention the fact$
+that I spoke of madam?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy winked, and was readmitted to the confidence of the democracy.$
+$
+Sir John Maxell was standing up behind his writing table, a fine, big$
+man with his grey hair neatly brushed back from his forehead and his$
+blue eyes magnified behind rimless glasses.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, coming round the table with slow steps.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely this is not the little Timothy I heard so much about years and$
+years ago!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is I, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I should never have known you. Sit down, my$
+boy. You smoke, of course‚M-^@M-^Teverybody smokes nowadays, but it seems$
+strange that a boy I knew in short breeches should have acquired the$
+habit. I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said, as Timothy lit his cigar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing to my discredit, I hope, sir?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he repeated diplomatically, ‚M-^@M-^\let it go at$
+that. Now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve come here because, five years ago, on the$
+twenty-third of December to be correct, I wrote to you, offering to give$
+you any help that lay in my power.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I won‚M-^@M-^Yt swear to the date,‚M-^@M-^] said Tim.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But I will,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the other. ‚M-^@M-^\I never forget a date, I never forget a$
+letter, I never forget the exact wording of that letter. My memory is an$
+amazing gift. Now just tell me what I can do for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I have had a pretty bad time in America. I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+running in a team with a crook and I‚M-^@M-^Yve had to pay out every cent I had$
+in the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded slowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then it is money you want,‚M-^@M-^] he said, without enthusiasm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly money, sir, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to try to start in London and I$
+thought, maybe, you might give me a letter of introduction to somebody.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, brightening up, ‚M-^@M-^\I think I can do that for you.$
+What did you think of doing in London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of getting some sort of secretarial job,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Not that$
+I know much about it!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John pinched his lower lip.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know a man who may help you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We were in the House of$
+Commons together and he would give you a place in one of his offices,$
+but unfortunately for you he has made a great deal of money and spends$
+most of his time at Newmarket.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds good to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance$
+there. Perhaps he‚M-^@M-^Yd try me out in that office?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Judge permitted himself to smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In Newmarket,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\our friend does very little more, I fear, than$
+waste his time and money on the race-course. He has half a dozen$
+horses‚M-^@M-^TI had a letter from him this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked back to his table, searched in the litter, and presently$
+amongst the papers pulled out a letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As a matter of fact, I had some business with him and I wrote to him$
+for information. The only thing he tells me is‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthis with a gesture of$
+despair‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\that Skyball and Polly Chaw‚M-^@M-^Tthose are the names of$
+race-horses, I presume‚M-^@M-^Twill win the two big handicaps next week and$
+that he has a flyer named Swift Kate that can beat anything‚M-^@M-^TI am$
+quoting his words‚M-^@M-^Ton legs over six furlongs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up over his glasses at Timothy, and on that young man‚M-^@M-^Ys face$
+was a seraphic smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds real nice to me,‚M-^@M-^] glowed Timothy.$
+$
+Remembering the injunctions of the servant, he was taking his adieu,$
+when his host asked, in a lower voice than that in which the$
+conversation had been carried on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you have not heard from your cousin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at him in astonishment. Had Sir John asked after the$
+Grand Llama of Tibet he would have been as well prepared to answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, no, sir‚M-^@M-^Tno‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tis he alive?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John Maxell looked at him sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alive? Of course. I thought you might have heard from him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\he disappeared. I only met him once when I was a$
+kid. Was he a friend‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tan acquaintance of yours?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John was drumming his fingers on the desk and his mind was far away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes and no,‚M-^@M-^] he said shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\I knew him, and at one time I was$
+friendly with him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly he glanced at his watch, and a look of consternation came to$
+his face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Great heavens!‚M-^@M-^] he cried. ‚M-^@M-^\I promised to meet my wife a quarter of an$
+hour ago. Good-bye! Good-bye!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He hand-shook Timothy from the room and the young man had to find his$
+way downstairs without guidance, because the manservant was at that$
+moment heavily engaged.$
+$
+From the floor below came a shrill, unpleasant sound, and Timothy$
+descended to find himself in the midst of a domestic crisis. There were$
+two ladies in the hall‚M-^@M-^Tone a mere silent, contained spectator, the$
+other the principal actress. He recognised her at once, but she did not$
+see him, because her attention was directed to the red-faced servant.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When I ring you on the ‚M-^@M-^Yphone, I expect to be answered,‚M-^@M-^] she was$
+saying. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to do except to sit round and keep your ears$
+open, you big, lazy devil!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But, my lady, I‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt answer me,‚M-^@M-^] she stormed. ‚M-^@M-^\If you think I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing better to do$
+than to sit at a ‚M-^@M-^Yphone waiting till you wake up, why, you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+mistaken‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys all. And if Sir John doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt fire you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about Sir John firing me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man with a sudden$
+change of manner. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve just had about as much of you as I can stand.$
+You keep your bossing for the movies, Lady Maxell. You‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to$
+try any of that stuff with me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was incapable of further speech, nor was there any necessity for it$
+since the man turned on his heels and disappeared into that mysterious$
+region which lies at the back of every entrance hall. Then for the first$
+time she saw Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you do, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She glared round at the interrupter, and for a moment he thought she$
+intended venting her anger on him. She was still frowning when he took$
+her limp hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre the Anderson boy, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked a little ungraciously.$
+$
+The old sense of antagonism was revived and intensified in him at the$
+touch of her hand. She was unchanged, looking, if anything, more pretty$
+than when he had seen her last, but the hardness at her mouth was$
+accentuated, and she had taken on an indefinable air of superiority$
+which differed very little from sheer insolence.$
+$
+A gold-rimmed lorgnette came up to survey him, and he was nettled‚M-^@M-^Tonly$
+women had the power to annoy him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt changed a bit,‚M-^@M-^] he bantered. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry your eyesight is$
+not so good as it was. Studio life is pretty tough on the eyes, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She closed her lorgnette with a snap, and turned to the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better see what Sir John is doing,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Ask him what he$
+thinks I am, that I should wait in the hall like a tramp.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was then that the girl came out of the shadow and Timothy saw her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is the ward or niece,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and sighed, for never$
+had he seen a human creature who so satisfied his eye. There is a beauty$
+which is neither statuesque nor cold, nor to be confounded with$
+prettiness. It is a beauty which depends upon no regularity of feature$
+or of colour, but which has its reason in its contradictions.$
+$
+The smiling Madonna whom Leonardo drew had such contradictory quality as$
+this girl possessed. For she was ninety per cent. child, and carried in$
+her face all the bubbling joy of youth. Yet she impressed Timothy as$
+being strange and unnatural. Her meekness, her ready obedience to carry$
+out the woman‚M-^@M-^Ys instruction, the very dignity of her departure‚M-^@M-^Tthese$
+things did not fit with the character he read in her face. Had she$
+turned curtly to this insolent woman and told her to carry her message$
+herself, or had she flown up the stairs calling for Sir John as she$
+went, these things would have been natural.$
+$
+Lady Maxell turned upon him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And see here, Mr. What‚M-^@M-^Ys-your-name, if you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of Sir John,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yll forget that I was ever in a studio. There are enough stories$
+about me in Bournemouth without your adding to the collection.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mother‚M-^@M-^Ys little thoroughbred!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy admiringly; ‚M-^@M-^\spoken like a$
+true little lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+In some respects he was wholly undisciplined, and had never learnt the$
+necessity of refraining from answering back. And the woman irritated$
+him, and irritation was a novel sensation.$
+$
+Her face was dark with rage, but it was upon Sir John, descending in$
+haste to meet his offended wife, that she turned the full batteries of$
+her anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know the time, of course. Your watch has stopped. It is hard$
+enough for me to keep my end up without you helping to make me look$
+foolish!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] protested Maxell in a flurry, ‚M-^@M-^\I assure you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can spend your time with this sort of trash,‚M-^@M-^] she indicated$
+Timothy, and Timothy bowed, ‚M-^@M-^\but you keep me waiting like a tailor‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+model at Sotheby‚M-^@M-^Ys, of all people in the world, when you know well$
+enough‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] pleaded the lawyer wearily, ‚M-^@M-^\my watch has certainly$
+stopped‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! You make me tired. What are you doing with this fellow? Do you$
+think I want reminding of movie days? Everybody knows this fellow‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+cheap gambler, who‚M-^@M-^Ys been fired out of every studio in England. You$
+allow your servants to insult me‚M-^@M-^Tand now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve brought this$
+prize-fighter to keep me in my place,‚M-^@M-^] and she pointed scornfully at the$
+amused Timothy.$
+$
+Half-way downstairs the girl stood watching the scene in silence, and it$
+was only when he became conscious of her presence that Timothy began to$
+feel a little uncomfortable.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, good-bye, Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry I intruded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\John, this man has insulted me! I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know$
+what he‚M-^@M-^Ys come for, but I suppose he wants something. He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of those$
+shifty fellows that hang around studios begging for money to bet with.$
+If you raise a hand to help him, why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I assure you,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John in his most pompous manner, ‚M-^@M-^\that this$
+young man has asked for nothing more than a letter of introduction. I$
+have a duty‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop!‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve a duty to me, too. Hold fast to your$
+money. Likely as not, you‚M-^@M-^Yll do neither with ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson$
+floating around.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was not her words, neither the contempt in her voice nor the insult$
+which stung him. The man who went twenty rounds with Kid Muldoon had$
+learnt to control his temper, but there was a new factor present‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+factor who wore a plain grey dress, and had two big, black eyes which$
+were now solemnly surveying him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is pretty difficult to give the lie to any$
+woman, but I tell you that what you say now is utterly false. I had no$
+intention when I came to Bournemouth of asking for anything that would$
+cost Sir John a penny. As to my past, I suppose it has been a little$
+eccentric, but it is clean, Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He meant no more than he said. He had no knowledge of Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+antecedents, or he might not have emphasised the purity of his own. But$
+the woman went back as though she had been whipped, and Timothy had a$
+momentary vision of a charging fury, before she flung herself upon him,$
+tearing at his face, shrieking aloud in her rage. . .$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He took off his hat and fanned himself. It was the first time he had$
+ever run away from trouble, but now he had almost flown. Those favoured$
+people who were in sight of Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys handsome villa, saw the$
+door swung open and a young man taking the front path in four strides$
+and the gate in another before he sped like the wind along the street.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy again.$
+$
+He went the longest way back to his hotel, to find that a telephone$
+message had been received from Sir John. It was short and to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt come again.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy read the slip and chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it likely?‚M-^@M-^] he asked the page who brought the message.$
+$
+Then he remembered the girl in grey, with the dark eyes, and he fingered$
+his smooth chin thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is worth while taking a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and$
+decided that, for the moment, it was not.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER X$
+$
+$
+LADY MAXELL yawned and put down the magazine she was reading. She$
+looked at her watch. It was ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. At such an hour Paris would be$
+beginning to wake up. The best people would still be in the midst of$
+their dinner, and Marie de Montdidier (born Hopkins) would be putting$
+the final dabs of powder on her nose in her dressing-room at the Folies$
+Berg√®res before making her first and her final appearance.$
+$
+The boulevards would be bright with light, and there would be lines of$
+twinkling autos in the Bois for the late diners at the Aromonville. She$
+looked across at the girl sitting under a big lamp in a window recess, a$
+book on her knees, but her mind and eyes elsewhere.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and the girl, with a start, woke from her reverie.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want me, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the matter with Sir John? You know him better than I do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know, Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt call me ‚M-^@M-^XLady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you to call me Sadie if you want to.‚M-^@M-^] There was a$
+silence. ‚M-^@M-^\Evidently you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want,‚M-^@M-^] snapped the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre what I$
+call a fine, sociable family. You seem to get your manners from your new$
+friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl went red.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My new friend?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Lady Maxell turned her back to her with$
+some resolution and resumed for a moment the reading of her magazine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt mind if you find any pleasure in talking to that kind of$
+insect,‚M-^@M-^] she said, putting the periodical down again. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, the world‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+full of those do-nothing boys. I suppose he knows there‚M-^@M-^Ys money coming$
+to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Very little, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little‚M-^@M-^Ys a lot to a man like that,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+think I am prejudiced because I was‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tannoyed the other day. That is$
+temperament.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the girl smiled, but it was a different kind of smile, and Lady$
+Maxell observed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can marry him as far as I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\These sneaking$
+meetings are not exactly complimentary to Sir John, that‚M-^@M-^Ys all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl closed her book, walked across to the shelf and put it away$
+before she spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yre speaking of Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I have met$
+him, but there has been nothing furtive in the meetings. He stopped me$
+in the park and apologised for having been responsible for the$
+scene‚M-^@M-^Tfor your temperament, you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked up sharply, but the girl met her eyes without$
+wavering.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt trying to be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] complained the older woman.$
+‚M-^@M-^\One never knows how deep you are. But I can tell you this, that sarcasm$
+is wasted on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sure of that,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked again, but apparently the girl was innocent of$
+offensive design.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say I met Mr. Anderson. He was very polite and very nice. Then I met$
+him again‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, I have met him several times,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\So far from his being a do-nothing, Lady Maxell, I think$
+you are doing him an injustice. He is working at the Parade Drug Store.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He will make a fine match for you,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will just$
+love having a shop-walker in the family!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+That ended the conversation for both of them, and they sat reading for a$
+quarter of an hour before Lady Maxell threw her magazine on the floor$
+and got up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John had a telegram yesterday that worried him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you$
+know what it was about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Honestly I do not know, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you ask$
+him yourself?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because he would tell me a lie,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman coolly, and the girl$
+winced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He brought all his money and securities from the Dawlish and County$
+Bank to-day and put them in his safe and he had the chief constable with$
+him for half an hour this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was news to the girl, and she was interested in spite of herself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to be frank with$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tfrankness pays sometimes. They called my marriage a romance of the$
+screen. Every newspaper said as much and I suppose that is true. But the$
+most romantic part of the marriage was my estate in Honolulu, my big$
+house in Paris and my bank balance. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys publicity man put all$
+that stuff about, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea that Sir John was highly disappointed$
+when he found he‚M-^@M-^Yd married me for myself alone. That‚M-^@M-^Ys how it strikes$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was a marriage which had shocked Society and had upset the smooth$
+current of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys life, placed in an entirely new light.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you very rich?‚M-^@M-^] she asked slowly, and Sadie laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rich! There was a tram fare between me and the workhouse the day I$
+married Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt blame him for being disappointed.$
+Lots of these cinema stars are worth millions‚M-^@M-^TI wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt one of them. I$
+married because I thought I was going to have a good time‚M-^@M-^Tlots of money$
+and plenty of travel‚M-^@M-^Tand I chose with my eyes shut.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was silent. For once Sadie Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys complaint had$
+justification. Sir John Maxell was not a spending man. He lived well,$
+but never outside the circle of necessity.$
+$
+The girl was about to speak, when there came a dramatic interruption.$
+$
+There was a ‚M-^@M-^\whang!‚M-^@M-^] a splintering of glass and something thudded$
+against the wall. Lady Maxell stood up as white as death.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was that?‚M-^@M-^] she gasped.$
+$
+The girl was pale, but she did not lose her nerve.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Somebody fired a shot. Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled aside the curtain. ‚M-^@M-^\The bullet went through the window.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Keep away from the window, you fool!‚M-^@M-^] screamed the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Turn out the$
+light! Ring the bell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mary moved across the room and turned the switch. They waited in$
+silence, but no other shot was fired. Perhaps it was an accident.$
+Somebody had been firing at a target. . . .$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go and tell my husband!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie. ‚M-^@M-^\Quickly!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl passed through the lighted hall upstairs and knocked at Sir$
+John‚M-^@M-^Ys door. There was no answer. She tried the door, but found it$
+locked. This was not unusual. He had a separate entrance to his study,$
+communicating by a balcony and a flight of stairs with the garden. A$
+wild fear seized her. Possibly Sir John had been in the garden when the$
+shot was fired; it may have been intended for him. She knocked again$
+louder, and this time she heard his step and the door was opened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you knock before?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\I was writing‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Then he saw her face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+The girl told him, and he made his way downstairs slowly, as was his$
+wont. He entered the drawing-room, switched on the lights, and without a$
+glance at his wife walked to the window and examined the shattered pane.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I imagined I heard a noise, but thought somebody had dropped something.$
+When did this happen? Just before you came up?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+Maxell looked from one to the other. His wife was almost speechless with$
+terror, and Mary Maxell alone was calm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has come already,‚M-^@M-^] he said musingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I did not think that this$
+would happen so soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked down to the hall where the telephone hung and rang through to$
+the police station, and the girl heard all he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is Sir John Maxell speaking. A shot has just been fired through$
+my window. No, not at me‚M-^@M-^TI was in my study. Apparently a rifle shot.$
+Yes, I was right‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Presently he came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The police will be here in a few moments to make a search of the$
+grounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I doubt whether they will catch the miscreant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it possible that it was an accident?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Accident?‚M-^@M-^] He smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly. ‚M-^@M-^\That kind of$
+accident is liable to happen again. You had better come up to my study,$
+both of you, till the police arrive,‚M-^@M-^] he said and led the way up the$
+stairs.$
+$
+He did not attempt to support his wife, though her nerve was obviously$
+shaken. Possibly he did not observe this fact until they were in the$
+room, for after a glance at her face he pushed a chair forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+The study was the one room to which his wife was seldom admitted.$
+Dominated as he was by her in other matters, he was firm on this point.$
+It was perhaps something of a novelty for her‚M-^@M-^Ta novelty which will$
+still the whimper of the crying child has something of the same effect$
+upon a nervous woman.$
+$
+The door of the safe was open and the big table was piled high with$
+sealed packages. The only money she saw was a thick pad of bank-notes$
+fastened about with a paper bandage, on which something was written. On$
+this she fixed her eyes. She had never seen so much money in her life,$
+and he must have noticed the attention this display of wealth had$
+created, for he took up the money and slipped it into a large envelope.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is your money, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he beamed over his glasses at the girl.$
+$
+She was feeling the reaction of her experience now and was trembling in$
+every limb. Yet she thought she recognised in this diversion an attempt$
+on his part to soothe her, and she smiled and tried hard to respond.$
+$
+They had been daily companions since she was a mite of four, and between$
+him and his dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child there was a whole lot of understanding$
+and sympathy which other people never knew.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My money, uncle?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I realised your investments last week,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I happened to know$
+that the Corporation in which the money stood had incurred very heavy$
+losses through some error in insurance. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a great deal, but I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt afford to let you take any further risks.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was, of course, a possibility of this shot having been fired by$
+accident,‚M-^@M-^] he went on, reverting to the matter which would naturally be$
+at the back of his mind. Then he fell into thought, pacing the room in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, stopping suddenly in front of the$
+girl. ‚M-^@M-^\You told me you were going to a concert.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before she could explain why she changed her mind they heard the sound$
+of voices in the hall.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stay here,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John. ‚M-^@M-^\It is the police. I will go down and tell$
+them all there is to know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When her husband had gone, Lady Maxell rose from her chair. The table,$
+with its sealed packages, drew her like a magnet. She fingered them one$
+by one, and came at last to the envelope containing Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys patrimony.$
+This she lifted in her hands, weighing it. Then, with a deep sigh, she$
+replaced the package on the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money there,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and Mary smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a great deal, I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid. Father was comparatively poor when he$
+died.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell thoughtfully; ‚M-^@M-^\more than I have ever$
+seen since I have been in this house, believe me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She returned, as though fascinated, and lifted the envelope again and$
+peered inside.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor, was he?‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you people don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what poverty$
+is. Do you know what all this means?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held the envelope up and there was a look in her face which the girl$
+had never seen before.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means comfort, it means freedom from worry, it means that you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have to pretend and make love to men whom you loathe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had risen and was staring at her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell!‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Why‚M-^@M-^Twhy‚M-^@M-^TI never think of$
+money like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why should you?‚M-^@M-^] said the woman roughly, as she flung the package on$
+the table. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been after money in quantities like that all my life.$
+It has always been dangling in front of me and eluding me‚M-^@M-^Teluding is$
+the word, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are all those pictures?‚M-^@M-^] she changed the subject abruptly,$
+pointing to the framed photographs which covered the walls. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+photographs of India, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John was born in Morocco and lived there$
+until he went to school. He speaks Arabic like a native. Did you know$
+that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys strange. Morocco!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know it?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been there‚M-^@M-^Tonce,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\Did Sir John go$
+often?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before he married, yes,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary. ‚M-^@M-^\He had large interests there at$
+one time, I think.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John came back at that moment, and Mary noticed that his first$
+glance was at the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, they‚M-^@M-^Yve found nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\neither footprints nor the$
+empty shell. They‚M-^@M-^Yre making a search of the grounds to-morrow. Lebbitter$
+wanted to post a man to protect the house in view of the other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What other matter?‚M-^@M-^] asked his wife quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\nothing really which concerns you. Of course,$
+I would not allow the police to do that. It would make the house more$
+conspicuous than it is at present.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at the two.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now,‚M-^@M-^] he said bluntly, ‚M-^@M-^\I think you had better go off to bed. I have$
+still a lot of work to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His wife obeyed without a word, and the girl was following her, when he$
+called her back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+the best man that ever lived, but I‚M-^@M-^Yve tried to make you happy, my dear,$
+in my own way. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been as a daughter to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked up at him with shining eyes. She could not trust herself to$
+speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Things haven‚M-^@M-^Yt gone as well as they might during the past year,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I made a colossal blunder, but I made it with my eyes open. It$
+hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt been pleasant for either of us, but there‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+regretting what you cannot mend. Mary, they tell me that you‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+seeing a lot of this young man Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was annoyed to find herself going red when there was really no$
+reason for it. She need not ask who ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^] were, she could guess.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been making inquiries about that boy,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+I can tell you this, he is straight. Perhaps he has led an$
+unconventional life, but all that he told Sadie was true. He‚M-^@M-^Ys clean,$
+and, Mary, that counts for something in this world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He seemed at a loss how to proceed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anything might happen,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Although I‚M-^@M-^Ym not an old man, I$
+have enemies. . . .‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have many enemies,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Some of them are hateful, and I want to$
+tell you this, that if trouble ever comes and that boy is within$
+call‚M-^@M-^Tgo to him. I know men, good, bad and indifferent; he‚M-^@M-^Ys neither bad$
+nor indifferent. And now, good night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He kissed her on the forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You needn‚M-^@M-^Yt tell your aunt what I‚M-^@M-^Yve been talking about,‚M-^@M-^] he said at$
+parting and led her to the door, closing and locking it behind her.$
+$
+He sat down in his chair for a very long time before he made a move,$
+then he began picking up the packages and carrying them to the safe. He$
+stopped half-way through and resumed his seat in the chair, waiting for$
+the hour to pass, by which time he judged the household would be asleep.$
+$
+At midnight he took a pair of rubber boots from a locker, pulled them$
+on, and went out through the door leading to the balcony, down the$
+covered stairway to the garden. Unerringly he walked across the lawn to$
+a corner of his grounds which his gardeners had never attempted to$
+cultivate. He stopped once and groped about in the bushes for a spade$
+which he had carefully planted there a few nights before. His hand$
+touched the rotting wood of an older spade and he smiled. For six years$
+the tool had remained where he had put it the last time he had visited$
+this No-Man‚M-^@M-^Ys-Land.$
+$
+Presently he came to a little hillock and began digging. The soil was$
+soft, and he had not gone far before the spade struck wood. He cleared a$
+space two feet square and drew from the earth a small crescent of wood.$
+It was, in fact, a part of the wooden cover of a well which had long$
+since gone dry but which had been covered up by its previous owner and$
+again covered by Maxell.$
+$
+Lying at full length on the ground, he reached down through the$
+aperture, and his fingers found a big rusty nail on which was suspended$
+a length of piano wire. At the end of the wire was attached a small$
+leather bag and this he drew up and unfastened, and putting the bag on$
+one side, let the free end of the wire fall into the well.$
+$
+He replaced the wood, covered it again with earth, all the time$
+exercising care, for, small as the aperture was, it was big enough for$
+even a man of his size to slip through.$
+$
+A cloaked figure which stood in the shadow of the bushes watching him,$
+which had followed him as noiselessly across the lawn, saw him lift the$
+bag and take it back to the house and disappear through the covered$
+stairway. So still a night it was, that the watcher could hear the click$
+of the lower door as Sir John locked it, and the soft pad of his feet as$
+they mounted the stairs.$
+$

+                               CHAPTER XI$
+$
+$
+MR. GOLDBERG, the manager and proprietor of the Parade Drug Store, was$
+a man who possessed neither a sense of imagination nor the spirit of$
+romance. He sent peremptorily for Timothy, and Timothy came with a$
+feeling that all was not well.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said Goldberg in his best magisterial manner, ‚M-^@M-^\I took$
+you into my shop because I was short of a man and because I understood$
+that you had had some business experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business experience,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy carefully, ‚M-^@M-^\of a kind.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I gave you particular instructions,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\on$
+one very vital point. We carry a full line of all the best proprietorial$
+medicines, and our customers can always get them upon application. Each$
+of those medicines we duplicate, as you know, providing the same$
+constituents and charging some sixpence to a shilling less‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, we$
+are out to save the public from being robbed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understand you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I don‚M-^@M-^Yt see much difference$
+between robbing the public and robbing the patent medicine proprietors,$
+and all that just-as-good stuff never did impress me, anyway. It stands$
+to reason,‚M-^@M-^] he said, leaning over the desk and speaking with the$
+earnestness of a crusader, ‚M-^@M-^\that the advertised article must be more$
+even in quality and it must be good all round. You can‚M-^@M-^Yt advertise a bad$
+article and get away with it, except on the first sale, and that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+pay the advertiser. The goods sell the goods, and the advertisement is$
+only to make you take the first lick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I do not want a lecture on advertising or on commercial morality,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Mr. Goldberg with ominous calm. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely want to tell you that you were$
+overheard by my chief assistant telling a customer not to ‚M-^@M-^Xtake a$
+chance‚M-^@M-^Y on one of my own pills.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys right,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, nodding his head vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Guilty, my$
+lord. What about it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have had a further complaint,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg, consulting with$
+elaborate ceremony a little notebook. ‚M-^@M-^\I understand that you have$
+initiated the awful practice of offering to toss customers for their$
+change. People have written me strong letters of complaint about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because they lost,‚M-^@M-^] said the indignant Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\what‚M-^@M-^Ys wrong about$
+that, anyway, Mr. Goldberg? I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pocket the money, and I win twice$
+out of every three times. If a fellow likes to take a chance as to$
+whether he gets sixpence or we get a shilling, why worry?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The outraged Mr. Goldberg brindled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sort of thing may be all right at a country fair or even in a$
+country shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not good enough for the Parade Drug$
+Store, Bournemouth, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll dispense with your services as from this$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre losing a good man,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, but Mr. Goldberg did$
+not seem to take that loss to heart.$
+$
+All ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] jobs ended violently. He never conceived$
+of them ending in any other way, and invariably regarded the sum of$
+money which was received in lieu of notice, or as compensation for$
+breach of contract, as being something in the nature of a nest-egg which$
+a kindly Providence had foreordained, and he was neither cast down nor$
+elated by the crisis in his affairs when, by a fortunate accident, he$
+met Mary Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tthe fortune was apparent, but the accident belonged to$
+the category which determined the hour at which trains leave stations.$
+$
+Hitherto, on the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys part, these meetings had been fraught with a$
+certain amount of apprehension, if not terror. They had begun when$
+Timothy had stopped her on the morning after his quarrel with Lady$
+Maxell, and had made bland inquiries as to that lady‚M-^@M-^Ys condition. Then$
+she had been in a panic and frantically anxious to end the interview,$
+and it required all her self-restraint to prevent her flying at top$
+speed from this wicked young man who had been so abominably rude.$
+$
+At their second meeting he had greeted her as an old friend, and she had$
+left him with the illusion of a life-time acquaintance. Hereafter$
+matters went smoothly, and they went so because Timothy Anderson was$
+unlike any of the other boys she had ever met.$
+$
+He paid her no compliments, he did not grow sentimental, he neither$
+tried to hold her hand nor kiss her, nor was he ever oppressed by that$
+overwhelming melancholy which is the heritage and pride of youth.$
+$
+Not once did he hint at an early decline or the possibility of his going$
+away to die in far lands. Instead he kept her in screams of laughter at$
+his interpretation of movie plays in the making. He did not ask for a$
+keepsake; the only request he made of her in this direction was one$
+which first took her breath away. Thereafter she never met him unless$
+she had in the bag which slung from her wrist one small box of matches;$
+for ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson had never possessed or carried the means of$
+ignition for his cigarette for one whole hour together.$
+$
+Timothy told her most of what the proprietor of the Parade Drug Store$
+had told him. The girl thought it was a joke, because that was exactly$
+the way Timothy presented the matter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you won‚M-^@M-^Yt be going away soon?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not till I go abroad,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy calmly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going abroad too?‚M-^@M-^] she asked in surprise.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to Paris and Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^Tespecially to Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\and afterwards I may run across to Algeria or to Egypt.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him with a new respect. She was less impressed by the$
+great possessions which his plans betrayed than by his confident$
+independence, and dimly she wondered why he was working at a drug-store$
+for low wages and wondered, too, whether he was‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you blushing about?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt blushing,‚M-^@M-^] she protested; ‚M-^@M-^\I was just wondering whether I$
+could ever afford a trip like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you can,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\If I can afford it,$
+you can, can‚M-^@M-^Yt you? If I go abroad and stay at the best hotels, and go$
+joy rides in the Alps and plan all this when I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got fifteen$
+shillings over my rent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt fifteen shillings over your rent!‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, aghast.$
+‚M-^@M-^\But how can you go abroad without money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was genuinely astounded that she could ask so absurd a question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\A little thing like money$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt really count.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre very silly,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, there was something I wanted$
+to tell you, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may call me Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to call you Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she replied.$
+$
+He shook his head with a pained expression.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Yll be ever so much more sociable if you call me Timothy and I call$
+you Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We can be very sociable without that familiarity,‚M-^@M-^] she said severely.$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was just going to tell you something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They sat on the grass together, on the shadow fringe of a big oak and$
+the spring sunshine wove its restless arabesques on her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\that last night I had two queer$
+experiences and I was scared; oh, scared to death!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eating things at night,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy oracularly, ‚M-^@M-^\especially before$
+you go to bed‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt dreaming,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly, ‚M-^@M-^\nor was it a nightmare. I$
+won‚M-^@M-^Yt tell you if you‚M-^@M-^Yre so horrid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym only speaking as an ex-chemist and druggist,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gravely;$
+‚M-^@M-^\but please forgive me. Tell me what it is, Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Mary Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he compromised.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\First I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the least worst,‚M-^@M-^] she began. ‚M-^@M-^\It happened about one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the morning. I had gone to bed awfully tired, but somehow I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt sleep, so I got up and walked about the room. I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt like$
+putting on the light because that meant drawing down the blinds which I$
+had let up when I went to bed, and the blinds make such a noise that I$
+thought the whole of the house would hear. So I put on my dressing-gown$
+and sat by the window. It was rather chilly, but my wrap was warm, and$
+sitting there I dozed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know how long, but it was nearly an hour,$
+I think. When I woke up I saw a man right in the centre of the lawn.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What sort of a man?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is the peculiar thing about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt a white$
+man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A coon?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I think it must have been a Moor. He wore a long white dress that$
+reached down to his ankles, and over that he had a big, heavy black$
+cloak.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He went round the corner of the house towards uncle‚M-^@M-^Ys private stairway$
+and he was gone quite a long time. My first thought was to awaken uncle$
+and tell him, but then I remembered that Sir John had spent a long time$
+in Morocco and possibly he knew that the man was about the house. You$
+see, we have had Moorish visitors before, when ships have come to Poole.$
+Once we had a very important man, a Kaid, and Sir John made queer tea$
+for him in glasses with mint and stuff. So I just didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what to$
+do. Whilst I was wondering whether I ought not at least to wake Lady$
+Maxell, he reappeared, walked across the lawn and went down the path$
+which leads to the back entrance‚M-^@M-^Tyou‚M-^@M-^Yre laughing at me,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you mistake for a laugh,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\is merely one$
+large smile of pleasure at being in your confidence.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was in two minds as to whether she would be angry or pleased, but$
+his tone changed to a more serious one.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like the idea of the gaudy East wandering loose under your$
+bedroom window in the middle of the night,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell Lady$
+Maxell this morning?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, she was up very early and has been out all day. I have not seen$
+her‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, she was not at breakfast. Now I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the really$
+serious thing that happened, and I do hope, Mr. Anderson, that you won‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+be flippant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Trust me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl had no reason to complain of his attitude when she had$
+described the shooting incident. He was aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is terrible!‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, it might have hit you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it might have hit me,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+whole point of my story, so far as you are concerned‚M-^@M-^TI mean, so far as$
+I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she added hastily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So fax as I am concerned too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\I just hate the$
+idea of anything even frightening you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She rose hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am going to shop now,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the hurry?‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ignoring his question, ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you to$
+think that uncle is feeling badly about you because of what has happened$
+in the house. He spoke to me of you last night, and he spoke very$
+nicely. I am worried to death about Sir John. He has made enemies in his$
+life, and I am sure that this shooting affair is the sequel to some old$
+feud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should say that is so,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He looked down at the grass very thoughtfully and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll go home,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I had better sleep this afternoon if I$
+am to be up all night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Up all night?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\What is happening? Is there a$
+ball or something?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will be something livelier than a ball,‚M-^@M-^] he said grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if I$
+find anybody in your garden to-night. And Miss Maxell, if you look out$
+of your window and you see a solitary figure on sentry-go don‚M-^@M-^Yt shoot,$
+because it will be me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] she gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt do it, Mr. Anderson. Uncle$
+would be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped her with a gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Possibly nobody will come to-night,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and as likely as not I$
+shall be pinched by the police as a suspicious character. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+chance that somebody will come, and that‚M-^@M-^Ys the chance I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to$
+take.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XII$
+$
+$
+TRUE to his word, he returned to his lodgings and spent the afternoon$
+in slumber. He had the gift which all great men possess, of being able$
+to sleep at will. He was staying at a boarding-house, and occupied a$
+room which had originally been a side veranda, but had been walled in$
+and converted into an extra bedroom. It was a remarkably convenient room$
+for him, as he had discovered on previous occasions. He had but to open$
+the window and drop on to the grass to make his exit without anybody in$
+the house being the wiser. More to the point, he could return at any$
+hour by the same route without disturbing the household.$
+$
+He had his supper, and whilst it was still very light he went out to$
+reconnoitre Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys demesne. He was able to make the circuit of the$
+house, which occupied a corner site and was isolated by two lanes, and$
+he saw nobody until, returning to the front of the house, a car drove up$
+and a woman alighted.$
+$
+He had no difficulty in recognising Lady Maxell, but the taxi interested$
+him more than the lady. It was smothered with mud and had evidently come$
+a long journey.$
+$
+As evidently she had hired it in some distant town and she had not as$
+yet finished with it, because she gave the man some directions and$
+money, and from the profound respect which the chauffeur showed, it was$
+clear that that money was merely a tip.$
+$
+Timothy stood where he could clearly be seen, but her back was toward$
+him all the time and she did not so much as glance in his direction when$
+she passed through the gate and up the garden path.$
+$
+It was curious, thought Timothy, that she did not take the car up the$
+drive to the house. More curious was it that she should, at this late$
+hour of the evening, have further use for it.$
+$
+He returned to his room, full of theories, the majority of which were$
+wholly wild and improbable. He lay on his bed, indulging in those dreams$
+which made up the happiest part of his life. Of late he had taken a new$
+and a more radiant pattern to the web of his fancy and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, fiddlesticks!‚M-^@M-^] he said in disgust, rolling over and sitting up with$
+a yawn.$
+$
+He heard the feet of the boarders on the gravel path outside, and once$
+he heard a girl say evidently to a visitor:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you see that funny room! That is Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was still an hour or so to be passed, and he joined the party in$
+the parlour so restless and distrait as to attract attention and a$
+little mild raillery from his fellow guests. He went back to his room,$
+turned on the light and pulled a trunk from under the bed.$
+$
+Somehow his mind had been running all day upon that erring cousin whose$
+name he bore and whose disappearance from public life was such a$
+mystery. Possibly it was Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys words which had brought Alfred$
+Cartwright to his mind. His mother had left him a number of family$
+documents, which, with the indolence of youth, he had never examined$
+very closely. He had the impression that they consisted in the main of$
+receipts, old diplomas of his father‚M-^@M-^Ys (who was an engineer) and sundry$
+other family documents which were not calculated to excite the curiosity$
+of the adventurous youth.$
+$
+He took out the two big envelopes in which these papers were kept and$
+turned them on to the bed, examining them one by one. Why his cousin$
+should be in his mind, why he should have taken this action at that$
+particular moment, the psychologist and the psychical expert alone can$
+explain. They may produce in explanation such esoteric phenomena as$
+auras, influences, and telepathies, and perhaps they are right.$
+$
+He had not searched long before he came upon a small package of$
+newspaper cuttings, bound about by a rubber band. He read them at first$
+without interest, and then without comprehension. There was one cutting,$
+however, which had been clipped from its context, which seemed to tell$
+the whole story of the rest. It ran:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\When Cartwright stood up for sentence he did not seem to be$
+    greatly troubled by his serious position. As the words ‚M-^@M-^Xtwenty$
+    years‚M-^@M-^Y passed Mr. Justice Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips, he fell back as if he$
+    had been shot. Then, springing to the edge of the dock, he$
+    hurled an epithet at his lordship. Some of his business$
+    associates suggest that the learned judge was a partner of$
+    Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^Tan astonishing and most improper suggestion to$
+    make. In view of the statement that the prisoner made before the$
+    trial, when suggestions had been made in a newspaper that the$
+    judge had been connected with him in business years before, and$
+    remembering that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys statement was to the effect that$
+    he had had no business transactions with the judge, it seems as$
+    though the outburst was made in a fit of spleen at the severity$
+    of the sentence. Sir John Maxell, after the case, took the$
+    unusual step of informing a Press representative that he$
+    intended placing his affairs in the hands of a committee for$
+    investigation, and had invited the Attorney-General to appoint$
+    that committee. ‚M-^@M-^XI insist upon this being done,‚M-^@M-^Y he said,$
+    ‚M-^@M-^Xbecause after the prisoner‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation I should not feel$
+    comfortable until an impartial committee had examined my$
+    affairs.‚M-^@M-^Y It is understood that after the investigation the$
+    learned judge intends retiring from the Bench.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy gasped. So that was the explanation. That was why Maxell had$
+written to him, that was why he made no reference at all to his father,$
+but to this disreputable cousin of his. Slowly he returned the package$
+to its envelope, dropped it into his trunk and pushed the trunk under$
+the bed.$
+$
+And that was the secret of Cousin Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys disappearance. He might$
+have guessed it; he might even have known had he troubled to look at$
+these papers.$
+$
+He sat on the bed, his hands clasping his knees. It was not a pleasant$
+reflection that he had a relative, and a relative moreover after whom he$
+was named, serving what might be a life sentence in a convict$
+establishment. But what made him think of the matter to-night?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson! Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round with a start. The man whose face was framed in the$
+open window might have been forty, fifty or sixty. It was a face heavily$
+seamed and sparsely bearded‚M-^@M-^Ta hollow-eyed, hungry face, but those eyes$
+burnt like fire. Timothy jumped up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Who are you ‚M-^@M-^XTimothying‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] the man laughed unpleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Can I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, you can come in,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He wondered what old acquaintance this was who had come to the tramp$
+level, and rapidly turned over in his mind all the possible candidates$
+for trampdom he had met.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the man again. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yve tracked you$
+here, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve been sitting in those bushes for two hours. I heard one$
+of the boarders say that it was your window and I waited till it was$
+dark before I came out.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All this is highly interesting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, surveying the shrunken$
+figure without enthusiasm, ‚M-^@M-^\but who are you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had a provisional pardon,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and they put me in a$
+sanatorium‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Yve something the matter with one of my lungs. It was$
+always a trouble to me. I was supposed to stay in the sanatorium‚M-^@M-^Tthat$
+was one of the terms on which I was pardoned‚M-^@M-^Tbut I escaped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy stared at him with open mouth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alfred Cartwright!‚M-^@M-^] he breathed.$
+$
+The man nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys me,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Timothy looked down at the edge of the black box.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that is why I was thinking about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, this beats$
+all! Sit down, won‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pulled a chair up for his visitor and again gazed on him with$
+curiosity but without affection. Something in Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys attitude annoyed$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not glad to see me?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not very,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\The truth is, you‚M-^@M-^Yve only just come into$
+existence so far as I am concerned. I thought you were dead.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not until a few minutes ago. I was reading the cuttings about your$
+trial‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that was what you were reading?‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to see ‚M-^@M-^Yem$
+one of these days. Do you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve come for?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was only at that moment that Sir John flashed through Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys mind.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I guess what you‚M-^@M-^Yve come after,‚M-^@M-^] he said slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre here to see$
+Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym here to see Mister Justice Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man between his teeth.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took the stump of a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lit it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\John Maxell and I have a score to settle, and it is going to be settled$
+very soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tide and weather permitting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy flippantly, recovering his$
+self-possession. ‚M-^@M-^\All that vendetta stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt go, Mr. Cartwright.‚M-^@M-^]$
+Then he asked in a flash: ‚M-^@M-^\Did you shoot at him last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise was a convincing reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shoot at him? I only got to this place this afternoon. It‚M-^@M-^Ys more likely$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys waiting to shoot at me, for the sanatorium people will have$
+telegraphed to him the moment I was missing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy walked to the window and pulled down the blinds.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now tell me, Mr. Cartwright, before we go any farther, do you still$
+persist in the story you told the court, that the judge was a party to$
+your swindle?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A party to it!‚M-^@M-^] said the other man furiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course he was! I was$
+using the money of my companies to buy concessions from the Moorish$
+Government, as much on his behalf as on mine. He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt in the Brigot$
+swindle‚M-^@M-^Tbut he held shares in the company I was financing. We located a$
+gold mine in the Angera country, and Maxell and I went across to Europe$
+every year regularly to look after our property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We had to keep it quiet because we secured the concessions from the$
+Pretender, knowing that he‚M-^@M-^Yd put the Sultan out of business the moment$
+he got busy. If it had been known, the Sultan would have repudiated the$
+concession, and our Government would have upheld the repudiation. Maxell$
+speaks the language like a native, and I learnt enough to get on with El$
+Mograb, who is the biggest thing amongst the rebel tribes. El Mograb$
+wanted us to stay there, Maxell and I; he‚M-^@M-^Yd have made us shereefs or$
+pashas, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd have done it, because I knew there was going to be an$
+investigation sooner or later into the affairs of my companies. But$
+Maxell wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have it. He always pretended that, so far as he knew, my$
+financing was straight. You know the rest,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\When I came before$
+Maxell, I thought I was safe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John allowed his affairs to be inspected,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\If he$
+had been engaged with you in this Morocco business, there must have been$
+papers to prove it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed harshly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course he‚M-^@M-^Yd allow his affairs to be investigated,‚M-^@M-^] he sneered. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you think that old fox couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt _cache_ all the documents that put him$
+wrong? Papers? Why, he must have enough papers to hang him, if you could$
+only find ‚M-^@M-^Yem!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+There was one thing he was determined that this man should _not_ do, and$
+that was to disturb the peace of mind, not of Sir John Maxell or his$
+wife, but of a certain goddess whose bedroom overlooked the lawn.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What am I going to do?‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going up to get$
+my share. And he‚M-^@M-^Yll be lucky if that‚M-^@M-^Ys all he loses. One of the mines$
+was sold to a syndicate last year‚M-^@M-^TI had news of it in gaol. He didn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+get much for it because he was in a hurry to sell‚M-^@M-^TI suppose his other$
+investments must have been going wrong twelve months ago‚M-^@M-^Tbut I want my$
+share of that!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you had best see Sir John in the morning. I will arrange an$
+interview.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the morning!‚M-^@M-^] said the other contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose you make the$
+arrangement, what would happen? When I went up there I should find a$
+couple of cops waiting to pinch me. I know John! I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and the man stared at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You think not?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\What has it to do with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite a lot,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely state that you will not see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright stroked his bristly chin undecidedly and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, well,‚M-^@M-^] he said in a milder tone, ‚M-^@M-^\maybe you can fix things up for$
+me in the morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you sleeping to-night?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had money, a little; and he had arranged to sleep at the house of a$
+man he had known in better times. Timothy accompanied him through the$
+window and into the street, and walked with him to the end of the road.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If my gamble had come off, you‚M-^@M-^Yd have benefited, Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+man unexpectedly, breaking in upon another topic which they were$
+discussing.$
+$
+They parted, and Timothy watched him out of sight, then turned on and$
+walked in the opposite direction, to take up his self-imposed vigil.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIII$
+$
+$
+THERE was something in the air that was electrical, and Mary Maxell$
+felt it as she sat at supper with Sir John and his wife. Maxell was$
+unusually silent and his wife amazingly so. She was nervous and almost$
+jumped when a remark was addressed to her. The old truculence which$
+distinguished her every word and action, her readiness to take offence,$
+to see a slight in the most innocent remark, and her combativeness$
+generally, had disappeared; she was almost meek when she replied to her$
+husband‚M-^@M-^Ys questions.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just went round shopping and then decided to call on a girl I had$
+known a long time ago. She lives in the country, and I felt so nervous$
+and depressed this morning that I thought a ride in a taxi would do me$
+good.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you take our car?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt decide until the last moment to go out to her, and then I went$
+by train one way.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad you went into the fresh air,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it will do you good.$
+The country is not so beautiful as Honolulu, but it is not without its$
+attractions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was unusual for the Judge to be sarcastic, but it was less usual for$
+Lady Maxell to accept sarcasm without a retort. To Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise she$
+made no reply, though a faint smile curved those straight lips of hers$
+for a second.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it was a burglar last night?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good heavens, no!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\Burglars do not shoot up the house$
+they burgle.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it is safe to have all this money in the house?‚M-^@M-^] she$
+asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly safe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that need alarm you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+No further reference was made to the matter, and presently Sir John went$
+up to his study. Mrs. Maxell did not go to the parlour, but drew a chair$
+to the fire in the dining-room and read, and the girl followed her$
+example. Presently the elder woman left the room and was gone a quarter$
+of an hour before she returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, so sweetly that the girl was startled, ‚M-^@M-^\such an$
+annoying thing has happened‚M-^@M-^TI have lost the key of my wardrobe. You$
+borrowed one of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicates the other day‚M-^@M-^Twhere did you put$
+the ring?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+John Maxell was a methodical and systematic man. He had a duplicate set$
+of all the keys in the house, and these as a rule were kept in a small$
+wall-safe in his own bedroom. He had never invited his wife to use that$
+receptacle, but she had a shrewd idea that the combination which was$
+denied to her had been given to the girl.$
+$
+Mary hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think if you asked Uncle‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the lady, ‚M-^@M-^\if I went to him now, he‚M-^@M-^Yd never forgive$
+me. If you know where the keys are, be an angel and get them for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl rose, and Lady Maxell followed her upstairs. Her own room was$
+next to her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys and communicated, but the door was invariably$
+locked on Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys side. Presently the girl came in to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here they are,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Please let me put them back quickly. I feel$
+very guilty at having taken them at all without his permission.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And for goodness‚M-^@M-^Y sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt tell him,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, examining the$
+keys.$
+$
+At last she found the one she wanted, but was a long time in the$
+process. She opened her bureau and the girl took the big key-ring from$
+her hand with such evident relief that Lady Maxell laughed.$
+$
+It had been easier than she thought and unless she made a blunder, the$
+key she had selected from the bunch while she was fumbling at the$
+bureau, would make just the difference‚M-^@M-^Tjust the difference.$
+$
+It was not customary for Sir John to come down from his study to enjoy$
+the ladies‚M-^@M-^Y company after dinner, but on this evening he made an$
+exception to his rule. He found his wife and ward reading, one on each$
+side of the fireplace. Lady Maxell looked up when her husband came in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a curious story, John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think it must be an$
+American story, about a woman who robbed her husband and the police$
+refused to arrest her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing curious about that,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\in law a wife$
+cannot rob her husband or a husband his wife.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that if you came to my Honolulu estate and stole my pearls,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said banteringly, ‚M-^@M-^\I could not have you arrested.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except for walking in my sleep!‚M-^@M-^] he said smilingly, and they both$
+laughed together.$
+$
+He had never seen her so amiable, and for the first time that day‚M-^@M-^Tit$
+had been a very trying and momentous day‚M-^@M-^The had his misgivings. She,$
+with the memory of her good day‚M-^@M-^Ys work, the excellent terms she had$
+arranged with the skipper of the _Lord Lawrence_, due to leave$
+Southampton for Cadiz at daylight the next morning, had no misgivings at$
+all, especially when she thought of a key she had placed under her$
+pillow. She had had the choice of two boats, the _Lord Lawrence_ and the$
+_Saffi_, but the _Saffi‚M-^@M-^Ys_ voyage would have been a long one, and its$
+port of destination might hold discomfort which she had no wish to$
+experience.$
+$
+The household retired at eleven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock, and it was past midnight before$
+Sadie Maxell heard her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys door close, and half an hour later$
+before the click of the switch told her that his light had been$
+extinguished.$
+$
+He was a ready sleeper, but she gave him yet another half-hour before$
+she opened the door of her bedroom and stepped out into the black$
+corridor. She moved noiselessly towards the study, her only fear being$
+that the baronet had locked the door before he came out. But this fear$
+was not well founded, and the door yielded readily to her touch. She was$
+dressed, and carried only a small attach√© case filled with the bare$
+necessities for the voyage.$
+$
+She pushed the catch of her electric lamp, located the safe and opened$
+it with no difficulty. She found herself surprisingly short of breath,$
+and her heart beat at such a furious rate that she thought it must be$
+audible to everybody in the house. The envelope with the money lay at$
+the bottom of the others, and she transferred its contents to her$
+attach√© case in a few seconds.$
+$
+Then her heart stood still. . . .$
+$
+It was only the faintest creak she heard, but it came from a corner of$
+the room where the door leading to the cupboard stairway was placed. She$
+saw a faint grey line of light appear‚M-^@M-^Tthe stairway had a glass roof and$
+admitted enough light to show her that the door was slowly opening. She$
+had to bite her lips to stop herself from screaming. To make her escape$
+or to rouse Sir John was impossible, and she opened the attach√© case$
+again, and with trembling fingers felt for the little revolver which she$
+had taken from her drawer. She felt safer now, yet she had not the$
+courage to switch on the light.$
+$
+She saw the figure of a man silhouetted in the opening, then the door$
+closed, and her terror bred of itself a certain courage.$
+$
+She flashed the light full on his face. The dead silence was broken when$
+she whispered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, God! Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who‚M-^@M-^Ys that?‚M-^@M-^] he whispered, and snatched the torch from her hand.$
+$
+He looked at her long and curiously, and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I expected to find that Maxell had taken most of my possessions,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I never thought he would take my wife!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us see what all this is about,‚M-^@M-^] boomed the big voice of John Maxell$
+almost in the man‚M-^@M-^Ys ear, he was so close, and suddenly the room was$
+flooded with light.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIV$
+$
+$
+THE self-appointed watcher found time pass very slowly. Twelve and one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock struck from a distant church, but there was no sign of midnight$
+assassins, and the house, looking very solemn and quiet in the light of$
+a waning moon, irritated and annoyed him. From the roadway where he$
+paced silently to and fro‚M-^@M-^The had taken the precaution of wearing a pair$
+of rubber-soled shoes‚M-^@M-^The could glimpse Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys window, and once he$
+thought he saw her looking out.$
+$
+He made a point of walking entirely round the house twice in every hour,$
+and it was on one of these excursions that he heard a sound which$
+brought him to a standstill. It was a sound like two pieces of flat$
+board being smacked together sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tap . . . tap!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and listened, but heard nothing further. Then he retraced his$
+footsteps to the front of the house and waited, but there was no sound$
+or sign. Another half-hour passed, and then a patrolling policeman came$
+along on the other side of the roadway. At the sight of the young man he$
+crossed the road, and Jim recognised an acquaintance of his drug-store$
+days. Nothing was to be gained by being evasive or mysterious, and$
+Timothy told the policeman frankly his object.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I heard about the shooting last night,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and the$
+inspector offered to put one of our men on duty here, but Sir John$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt hear of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took a professional look at the house, and pointed to its dark upper$
+windows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That house is asleep‚M-^@M-^Tyou needn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about that,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\besides,$
+it‚M-^@M-^Yll be daylight in two hours, and a burglar wants that time to get$
+home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy paused irresolutely. It seemed absurd to wait any longer, and$
+besides, to be consistent he must be prepared to adopt this watchman$
+r√¥le every night.$
+$
+There was no particular reason why Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy should choose$
+this night or any other. He had half expected to see Cartwright and was$
+agreeably disappointed that he did not loom into view.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre right,‚M-^@M-^] he said to the policeman. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll walk along down$
+the road with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They must have walked a quarter of a mile, and were standing chatting at$
+the corner of the street, when a sound, borne clearly on the night air,$
+made both men look back in the direction whence they had come. They saw$
+two glaring spots of light somewhere in the vicinity of the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+house.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a car,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, ‚M-^@M-^\what is it doing there at this time$
+of the morning? There is nobody sick in the house, is there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head. Already he had begun to walk back, and the$
+policeman, sensing something wrong, kept him company. They had covered$
+half the distance which separated them from the car, when it began to$
+move toward them, gathering speed. It flashed past and Timothy saw$
+nothing save the driver, for the hood was raised and its canvas blinds$
+hid whatever passenger it carried.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It came in from the other end of the avenue,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman$
+unnecessarily. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe Sir John is going a long journey and is starting$
+early.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell would have told me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, troubled. ‚M-^@M-^\I nearly took$
+a chance and made a jump for that car.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was one of the few chances Timothy did not take, and one that he$
+bitterly regretted afterwards.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical policeman, ‚M-^@M-^\I should have been looking$
+for the ambulance for you now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was no longer satisfied to play the r√¥le of the silent watcher.$
+When he came to the house he went boldly through the gate and up the$
+drive, and his warrant for the intrusion was the officer who followed$
+him. It was then that he saw the open window of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys room, and his$
+heart leapt into his mouth. He quickened his step, but just as he came$
+under the window, she appeared, and Timothy sighed his relief.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is that you?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a low worried voice; ‚M-^@M-^\is that Mr. Anderson?$
+Thank heaven you‚M-^@M-^Yve come! Wait, I will come down and open the door for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked to the entrance, and presently the door was opened and the$
+girl, dressed in a wrapper, appeared. She tried to keep her voice$
+steady, but the strain of the past half-hour had been too much for her,$
+and she was on the verge of tears when Timothy put his arm about her$
+shaking shoulders and forced her down into a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and tell us what has happened.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at the officer and tried to speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a servant,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman; ‚M-^@M-^\perhaps he knows something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A man dressed in shirt and trousers was coming down the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can‚M-^@M-^Yt make him hear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\or Lady Maxell, either.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know, sir. The young lady woke me and asked me to rouse Sir$
+John.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sorry I am so silly. I am probably$
+making a lot of trouble over nothing. It happened nearly an hour ago, I$
+was asleep and I heard a sound; thought I was dreaming of what happened$
+last night. It sounded like two shots, but, whatever it was, it woke$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know. I thought I heard them too,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you were out there all the time?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and put out her hand$
+to him.$
+$
+For that look she gave him Timothy would have stayed out the three$
+hundred and sixty-five nights in the year.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I lay for a very long time, thinking that the sound would wake my$
+uncle, but I heard nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is your room near Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys?‚M-^@M-^] asked the policeman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, mine is on this side of the building; Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+sleep on the other side. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what it was, but something alarmed$
+me and filled me with terror‚M-^@M-^Tsomething that made my flesh go rough and$
+cold‚M-^@M-^Toh, it was horrible!‚M-^@M-^] she shuddered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt endure it any longer, so I got out of bed and went out into$
+the corridor to wake uncle. Just then I heard a sound outside my window,$
+but I was just too terrified to look out. Then I heard a motor-car and$
+footsteps on the path outside. I went to Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys door and knocked,$
+but got no answer. Then I tried Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys door, but there was no$
+answer there either. So I went to Johnson‚M-^@M-^Ys room and woke him;‚M-^@M-^] she$
+looked at Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Tthought that you might be there, so I came$
+back to the open window and looked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Show me Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman to the servant, and the$
+three men passed up the stairs, followed by the girl.$
+$
+The door which the man indicated was locked, and even when the policeman$
+hammered on the panel there was no response.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think the key of my door will unlock almost any of the room doors,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the girl suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John told me once that all the room locks$
+were made on the same plan.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She went away and came back with a key. The policeman fitted it in the$
+lock and opened the door, feeling for and finding the electric switch as$
+he entered. The room was empty, and apparently the bed had not been$
+occupied.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where does that door lead?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That leads to Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\there is a key on$
+this side.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This door he found was open and again they found an empty room and a bed$
+which had not been slept in. They looked at one another.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Sir John be in his study till late?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is at the end of the corridor,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a broken voice, for she$
+felt that the study held some dreadful secret.$
+$
+This door was locked too, locked from the inside. By now the policeman$
+was standing on no ceremony, and with a quick thrust of his shoulder he$
+broke the lock, and the door flew open.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us have a little light,‚M-^@M-^] he said, unconsciously copying words which$
+had been spoken in that room an hour before.$
+$
+The room was empty, but here at any rate was evidence. The safe stood$
+open, the fireplace was filled with glowing ashes, and the air of the$
+room was pungent with the scent of burnt paper.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is this?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy, pointing to the ground.$
+$
+The floor of the study was covered with a thick, biscuit-coloured$
+carpet, and ‚M-^@M-^\this‚M-^@M-^] was a round, dark stain which was still wet. The$
+policeman went on his knees and examined it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is blood,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly; ‚M-^@M-^\there‚M-^@M-^Ys another patch near the door.$
+Where does this door lead? Catch that girl, she‚M-^@M-^Ys fainting!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was just in time to slip his arm round Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys waist before she$
+collapsed. By this time the household was aroused, and a woman servant$
+was on the spot to take charge of Mary. When Timothy had rejoined the$
+policeman, that officer had discovered where the door led.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You go down a stairway into the garden,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It looks as if two$
+shots were fired here. Look, there‚M-^@M-^Ys the mark of both of them on the$
+wall.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you suggest that two people have been killed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The policeman nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\One was shot in the middle of the room, and one was probably shot on$
+the way to the door. What do you make of this?‚M-^@M-^] and he held up a bag,$
+discoloured and weather-worn, with a handle to which was fastened a long$
+length of rusty wire.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is empty,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, examining the contents of the little$
+grip which, up till an hour before, had held John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys most$
+jealously guarded secrets.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll use this ‚M-^@M-^Yphone,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better stay by, Mr.$
+Anderson. We shall want your evidence‚M-^@M-^Tit will be important. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+often we have a man watching outside a house where a murder is$
+committed‚M-^@M-^Tprobably two.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The sun had risen before the preliminary interrogation and the search of$
+the house and grounds had been concluded. Blewitt the detective, who had$
+taken charge of the case, came into the dining-room, where a worried$
+servant was serving coffee for the investigators, and dropped down on to$
+a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue and there‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue alone,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and drew from$
+his pocket a soft hat. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you recognise this, Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that was worn last night by the man I spoke to you$
+about.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I could swear to it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Where did you find it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Outside,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective; ‚M-^@M-^\and that is all we have to go on. There$
+is no sign of any body. My first theory stands.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You believe that the murderer carried Sir John and Lady Maxell into the$
+car and drove away with them?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\but that pre-supposes that$
+the chauffeur was in the plot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He may have been and he may have been terrorised,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Even a taxi-driver will be obliging if you stick a gun in his stomach.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Miss Maxell have heard‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] began Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell heard,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\but was afraid to look out.$
+She also heard two shots. My theory is that Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+were killed, that the murderer first locked both the bedrooms, went$
+through Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys papers, presumably to discover something$
+incriminating himself, and to destroy such documents.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But why not leave the bodies?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because without the bodies no indictment of murder could hold against$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson turned as the girl came in. She was looking very tired,$
+but she was calmer than she had been earlier in the morning.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is there any news?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have searched every inch of the ground,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated to ask the question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am afraid,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy gently, ‚M-^@M-^\that there is very little hope.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But have you searched everywhere?‚M-^@M-^] insisted the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everywhere,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+Soon after, Timothy took the girl away to an hotel for breakfast and to$
+arrange for a room, and the house was left in charge of the police.$
+Later came the famous detective Gilborne, who made an independent$
+search, but he, like his predecessors, failed to discover any further$
+evidence, because he also knew nothing of the disused well, which lay$
+hidden under a rubbish heap.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XV$
+$
+$
+WHO killed Sir John Maxell and his wife?$
+$
+Where had their bodies been hidden? These were the two questions which$
+were to agitate England for the traditional space of nine days. For one$
+day, at any rate, they formed the sole topic of speculation amongst the$
+intelligent section of fifty million people.$
+$
+The first question was easier to answer than the second. It was obvious$
+to the newsmen that the murderer was Cartwright, whose threats of$
+vengeance were recalled and whose appearance at Bournemouth had been$
+described at second-hand by the detective in charge of the case.$
+First-hand information was for the moment denied the pressmen, for$
+Timothy, fully dressed, lay on his bed in a sound sleep. Happily for$
+him, neither then nor later did any of the enterprising newspaper men$
+associate the ‚M-^@M-^\A. C.‚M-^@M-^] in his name with the wanted criminal. He was at$
+least spared that embarrassment.$
+$
+But the story of his vigil as ‚M-^@M-^\a friend of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] was in print long$
+before he woke up to find a small and impatient army of reporters$
+waiting to interview him. He answered the reporters‚M-^@M-^Y interrogations as$
+briefly as possible, bathed and changed and made his way to the hotel$
+where the girl was. She was leaving as he arrived, and the warmth of her$
+greeting almost banished the depression which lay upon him. She put her$
+arm through his so naturally that he did not realise his wonderful$
+fortune.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve got something to tell you,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\unless you know already.$
+All my money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped with a gasp.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean that?‚M-^@M-^] he said seriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is true,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe it was very little and my loss is$
+so insignificant compared with the other awful affair that I am not$
+worrying about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John had money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just seen his lawyers,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\they have been to the bank$
+and there is not a hundred pounds to his credit, and that amount will be$
+absorbed by the cheques he has drawn. He drew a very, very large sum,$
+including my money, from the bank two days ago. You know,‚M-^@M-^] she went on,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that Sir John contemplated leaving for America? He had already$
+given me a hint, asking me how long it would take me to pack my$
+belongings, and I fancy that had something to do with the telegram he$
+received‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Announcing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys escape,‚M-^@M-^] nodded Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was so kind and so gentle,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, her eyes filling with$
+tears, ‚M-^@M-^\that to me he was more like a father. Oh, it is awful, awful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you?‚M-^@M-^] asked the agitated Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do? Good$
+heavens! It is dreadful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall have to work,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl practically and with a little$
+smile. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that will kill me. Hundreds of thousands of girls$
+have to work for their living, Timothy, and I shall have to work for$
+mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy drew a long breath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not if I can help it, you won‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sure I shall make a$
+lot of money. I can feel it in my bones. If a man takes a job‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt talk like that,‚M-^@M-^] she said, pressing his arm, ‚M-^@M-^\and anyway,$
+how could I let you help me or keep me? That sort of thing isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+done‚M-^@M-^Tnot by nice girls.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She laughed, but became sober again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know that Sir John was very much interested in you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In me?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I told you so the other day. I think he liked you, because he was$
+saying how uncomfortable you must be at Vermont House, living in that$
+queer little room of yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did he know I was living at Vermont House?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Vermont House happens to be Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys property,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\In fact, I$
+think it is the only realisable piece of property he has, now that the$
+money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What shall you do immediately?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I think the first step is to get out of$
+this hotel, which is much too expensive for me. I have a few pounds in$
+the bank, but that won‚M-^@M-^Yt last very long.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At his earnest entreaty she agreed to see a solicitor and appoint him to$
+save whatever was possible from the wreckage of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys estate. Two$
+hours passed like as many minutes, until Timothy remembered that he had$
+an appointment with a London reporter‚M-^@M-^Tone Brennan. Brennan he had known$
+in his cinema days, and Timothy literally fell upon his neck.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to tell the boys that hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt already been told,‚M-^@M-^] he said,$
+putting down the newspaper which Brennan handed to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I am as anxious$
+for news as you are. Have there been any developments?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter, ‚M-^@M-^\except that Sir John had no money at the$
+bank and no money could be found in the house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I know,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all his securities were drawn out two days ago.$
+That was the stuff that Cartwright was after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does Miss Maxell know‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Brennan began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does know and she took it like a brick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was about twenty thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] Brennan went on. ‚M-^@M-^\The only other$
+clue the police have is that the safe was opened by Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicate$
+key. The old man had two sets made, one of which he used to keep in his$
+combination safe in his bedroom and the other he carried around with$
+him. Miss Maxell told a story that the night before the murder Lady$
+Maxell asked her to secure possession of the keys in order to open a$
+bureau.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see. Is it suggested that Lady Maxell detached the key of the safe$
+and that it was she who opened it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one theory,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\the police have miles of ‚M-^@M-^Yem!$
+They‚M-^@M-^Yve got everything except the bodies and the murderer. Now come out$
+with that story, Anderson! You must know a great deal more than you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+told, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym simply without a new fact that these evening papers$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got, to hang my story on. Why did Cartwright come to your room,$
+anyway? Do you know him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was an acquaintance of my father‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and perhaps he thought I knew Maxell better than I did.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sounds pretty thin,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter. ‚M-^@M-^\Why should he come to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose I am the only person he knew or knew about,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+patiently. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose he‚M-^@M-^Yd been all round Bournemouth trying to find a$
+familiar name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the reporter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I was a kid when he went to gaol. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+imagine I knew him at all, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had gone out to meet the girl, forgetting to take his watch, and now$
+he was looking round for it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a theory,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Lady Maxell isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+dead at all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Cartwright killed Maxell and Lady Maxell witnessed the murder.$
+Suppose this fellow had to decide whether he would kill the witness or$
+whether he would go away with her? You said the motor-car which came to$
+the house in the middle of the night was the same as that in which Lady$
+Maxell came home. Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely that she should have told the$
+murderer, for some reason or other, that the car was coming, because$
+evidently she had arranged for it to come, and that they went away$
+together? Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely, too, that she was in the plot, and that, so$
+far from being a victim, she was one of the criminals? We know her$
+antecedents. There was some trouble over her stabbing a young American,$
+Reggie van Rhyn. In fact, most of the evidence seems to incriminate her.$
+There is the key, for example. Who else but she could have taken the$
+duplicate key? Doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt it look as though she planned the whole thing,$
+and that her accomplice came in at the last moment to help her get away$
+and possibly to settle Sir John?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take the incident of the two locked bedrooms. Obviously somebody who$
+lived in the house and who knew the family routine must have done that.$
+Both Sir John and Lady Maxell were in the habit of fastening their doors$
+at night, and the servants did not go into the bedrooms unless they were$
+rung for. It seems to me fairly clear that Lady Maxell locked the doors$
+so that the suspicions of the servants should not be aroused in the$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If I had your powers of deduction,‚M-^@M-^] said the admiring Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+should never miss a winner. Where the blazes is my watch?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try under the pillow,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I never put it there,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy, but nevertheless turned the$
+pillow over and stood gaping.$
+$
+For beneath the pillow was a long, stout envelope with a tell-tale blood$
+stain in one corner.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake!‚M-^@M-^] breathed Timothy, and took up the package.$
+$
+It bore no address and was sealed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What on earth is this?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can tell you what those stains are,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Brennan. ‚M-^@M-^\Is$
+there any name on it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open it,‚M-^@M-^] suggested the reporter, and the other obeyed.$
+$
+The contents were even more astonishing, for they consisted of a thick$
+pad of money. They were new Bank of England notes and were bound about$
+by a tight band of paper. On the band was written in Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+handwriting:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Proceeds of the sale of stocks held in trust for Miss Mary$
+    Maxell. ¬£21,300.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The detective in charge of the case was a man of many theories. But his$
+new theory was an uncomfortable one for Timothy Anderson.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This puts a new light upon the case,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+being perfectly frank with you, Mr. Anderson, that the new light isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+very favourable to you. Here you are, outside the building when the$
+crime is committed. You are seen by a policeman a few minutes after the$
+shots are fired, and a portion of the money stolen from the house is$
+discovered under your pillow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Discovered by me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\in the presence of a witness. And are$
+you suggesting that, whilst I was with your policeman, I was also$
+driving the car, or that I was wearing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys cap which was found$
+in the grounds? Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve the finger-print of your man and you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+at liberty to compare it with mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a finger-print anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\it is the print$
+of a knuckle and we do not keep a record of knuckles. No, I admit that$
+the motor-car conflicts a little bit with my theory. Have you any$
+suggestion to offer?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The only suggestion I can make,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is that Cartwright, in a$
+hurry to get away and knowing the position of my room, hid the money$
+there for fear he should be caught with the goods. At any rate, if I$
+were the criminal I would not hide a bloodstained envelope under my$
+pillow. I should at least have the intelligence to burn the envelope and$
+put the money where the servants of this house could not find it. Why,$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt you see,‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously, ‚M-^@M-^\that any of the servants at this$
+boarding-house would have found the envelope if I hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The detective scratched his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a very queer case.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And it is being investigated by very queer people,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+irritably.$
+$
+A little further investigation, however, relieved Timothy of all$
+suspicion. He had not returned to the house until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock that$
+morning. The maid, who had taken him a cup of tea at eight, noticing$
+that he had been out all night, thought it was an excellent opportunity$
+to straighten the room to ‚M-^@M-^\get it off her mind,‚M-^@M-^] as she said. She did$
+not remake the bed, but had tidied it. Whilst sweeping she had seen the$
+envelope lying on the floor near the open window and had picked it up$
+and, for want of a better place, thinking ‚M-^@M-^\it was private‚M-^@M-^] had slipped$
+it under Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys pillow.$
+$
+As Timothy had not been out of sight of the police since the tragedy$
+until his return to his lodgings, there could be no suggestion that he$
+had any part in hiding the envelope. Whatever irritation he felt was$
+dispelled by his large and generous satisfaction when the poverty which$
+threatened Mary was averted. But why should Cartwright hide the money$
+there? Why should he stop in his headlong flight to come to the window,$
+as evidently he did, and throw the package into the room? There were a$
+hundred places where he might have left it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That cousin stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt work,‚M-^@M-^] thought Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and if you think$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys going to rely upon his relationship with me and can use me to look$
+after his money, he‚M-^@M-^Ys made one large mistake.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw the girl again at the official inquiry, and met her on the day$
+after. She was going to Bath where she had some distant relations, and$
+they had met to say good-bye.$
+$
+It was a gloomy occasion‚M-^@M-^Tless gloomy for Timothy than for the girl,$
+because he was already planning a move to the town in which she was$
+taking up her quarters. This cheerful view was banished, however, when$
+she explained that her stay in Bath was merely a temporary expedient.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew has wired asking me to come‚M-^@M-^Tand it seems as good a place$
+as any for a few months. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I shall stay here any longer,‚M-^@M-^]$
+she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want a change of air and a change of scene. Timothy, I feel$
+that I shall never get over Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never is a very long time, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently, and she could$
+only wonder at the tender kindness in his voice.$
+$
+She had little time to wonder, however, for she had a proposition to$
+make to him and she hardly knew how to reduce it to words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you‚M-^@M-^Tare you‚M-^@M-^Tworking?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys broad smile answered her plainly that he was not.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact is,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt quite decided what I am going$
+to do. If you were going down to Bath for good, I was going down to Bath$
+also. Maybe I could start a druggist‚M-^@M-^Ys or buy a store, or run errands$
+for somebody. I am the most accommodating worker.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she began and stopped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he repeated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had an idea that maybe you would like to go on and conduct an$
+independent search‚M-^@M-^Tindependent of the police, I mean‚M-^@M-^Tand find$
+something about the man who killed Sir John, and perhaps bring him to$
+justice. You know, I think you are clever enough,‚M-^@M-^] she went on$
+hurriedly, ‚M-^@M-^\and it would be work after your own heart.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was looking at her steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly, ‚M-^@M-^\but that involves spending a$
+whole lot of money. What misguided person do you suggest would send me$
+out on that kind of job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I thought‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated, and then a little incoherently,$
+‚M-^@M-^\You see, I have the money‚M-^@M-^Tmainly through you‚M-^@M-^Tmy own money, I mean. I$
+feel I have a duty to my poor uncle and I could trust you to do your$
+very best. I could afford it, Timothy‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe laid her hand on his arm and$
+looked up at him almost beseechingly‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\indeed I can afford it. I have$
+more money than I shall ever spend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He patted her hand softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is just the kind of job I should like, and with$
+anybody‚M-^@M-^Ys money but yours, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd be out of the country in two shakes,$
+looking for Mr. Cartwright in the most expensive cities of the world.$
+But, my dear, I cannot accept your commission, because I know just what$
+lies behind it. You think I‚M-^@M-^Ym a restless, rather shiftless sort of$
+fellow, and you want to give me a good time‚M-^@M-^Twith your money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\thank you, but, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was disappointed and for a moment a little hurt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Would two hundred pounds‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she suggested timidly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not your two hundred,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\That lawyer of yours should take$
+better care of your money, Mary. He shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt allow you to make these$
+tempting offers to young men,‚M-^@M-^] he was smiling now. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you go abroad?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps‚M-^@M-^Tsome day,‚M-^@M-^] she said vaguely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John wanted me to go‚M-^@M-^Tand I$
+feel that I should be pleasing him. Some day, yes, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll go over at the same time as you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought of$
+taking a chance in Paris for a while‚M-^@M-^Tyou can make big money in Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In‚M-^@M-^Ta while?‚M-^@M-^] she smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a minute,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if the horse and the jockey are of$
+the same way of thinking. I know a fellow who races pretty extensively$
+in France. He has a horse called Flirt‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held out her hand for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, you‚M-^@M-^Yre incorrigible,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+She did not see him again for twelve months, not indeed until, after a$
+winter spent in Madeira, she put her foot over the gangway of the s.s.$
+_Tigilanes_ and met the quizzical smile of the youth who was waiting to$
+receive her.$
+$
+For Timothy had been in Funchal a month, seeing but unseen, since Mary$
+was generally in bed before the Casino woke up and play reached any$
+exciting level.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVI$
+$
+$
+TIMOTHY sat now on an upturned trunk, his elbows on the rails of the$
+s.s. _Tigilanes_ and his speculative eye roving the river front of$
+Liverpool.$
+$
+It was the last hour of the voyage, and Timothy, who had left Funchal$
+with four hundred pounds in his pocket-book, had exactly three genuine$
+shillings and a five-milreis piece of dubious quality.$
+$
+A man strolled along the deck and fell in at his side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cleaned you out last night, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^] he asked sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh? Oh, yes, I believe they did. That red-haired man had all the luck$
+and most of the cards.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He smiled and Timothy had a swift, happy smile that brought tired little$
+ridges under his eyes. He was not only good-looking and young, but he$
+was interesting.$
+$
+The man at his side took the cigar from his teeth and looked at it$
+before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, you know they were crooks‚M-^@M-^Tthey work this coast line$
+regularly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round, shocked and pained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say? Crooks! What, that little red-haired fellow who has been$
+trying to pick a quarrel with me all the voyage, and the tall,$
+nice-looking Englishman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His companion nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember the Captain warned us not to play cards‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They always do that to be on the safe side,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, but he was$
+obviously uneasy. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I knew they were crooks‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Knew! Good lord! Anybody will tell you. Ask the purser. Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been stung and you can do nothing. The best thing to do is to grin and$
+bear your losses. It is experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy felt the three honest shillings in his pocket and whistled$
+dismally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I were sure‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned abruptly away and raced down the main companion-way to the$
+purser‚M-^@M-^Ys little office under the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Macleod, I want to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir,‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tall pursers are a little suspicious,‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\anything wrong with$
+your bill?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No‚M-^@M-^Tnot unless his name‚M-^@M-^Ys Bill. Shall I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser opened the half-door and admitted him to the sanctuary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are two fellows aboard this packet‚M-^@M-^Ta red-haired fellow named$
+Chelwyn and a disguised duke named Brown‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you know about ‚M-^@M-^Yem?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser made a face. It was intended to convey his lack of real$
+interest in either.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll put it plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said the patient Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Are they crooks?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They play cards,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser diplomatically.$
+$
+He desired at this the eleventh hour to avoid scandal, explanations, and$
+such other phenomena which he associated in his mind with the$
+confrontation of the wise men and their dupes. That sort of thing$
+brought the Line into disrepute, and indirectly reflected upon the$
+ship‚M-^@M-^Ys officers. Besides, the ship was making port, and, like all$
+pursers, he was up to his eyes in work and frantically anxious to clear$
+it off in a minimum time so that he could take a train to his little$
+villa at Lytham, where his family was established.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mr. Anderson, if you‚M-^@M-^Yve been stung,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but the$
+captain gives fair warning the first night out of Cape Town and$
+Madeira‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys where you came aboard, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^Tand there were notices$
+posted up, both in the saloon and in the smoking-room. Have you lost$
+much?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up with some sympathy at the tall, athletic figure with the$
+tired, smiling eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I cleared up ¬£500 at the Funchal Casino,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I reckon I$
+have spent ¬£100 legitimately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The rest is gone, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, Mr. Anderson, I am$
+afraid I can do nothing. The best thing to do is to mark it down against$
+‚M-^@M-^XExperience‚M-^@M-^Y.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll forgive you for being philosophical about my losses,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you be kind enough to tell me the number of Mr. Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+cabin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two seventy-four,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\I say, Mr. Anderson, if I were you$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yd let the matter drop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you would, dear old thing,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, shaking him warmly by$
+the hand, ‚M-^@M-^\and if I were you I should let it drop too. But, as I am$
+me‚M-^@M-^T274, I think you said?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to make any trouble, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+alarmed purser. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve done our best to make you comfortable on the$
+voyage.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I did my best to pay for my ticket, so we‚M-^@M-^Yre quits,‚M-^@M-^] and with a$
+wave of his hand Timothy strode out of the cabin, dodged down past the$
+steward carrying up the luggage to the next deck, and walked swiftly$
+along the carpeted corridor till he found a little number-plate bearing$
+the figures ‚M-^@M-^\274.‚M-^@M-^] He knocked at the cabin door, and gruff voice said,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come in!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Chelwyn, the red-haired man, was in his shirt sleeves, fastening his$
+collar. Brown was sitting on the edge of his bunk, smoking a cigarette,$
+and Chelwyn, who had seen Timothy reflected in the mirror as he came in,$
+was first to recognise him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo, Mr. Anderson, do you want anything?‚M-^@M-^] he asked politely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sorry$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yve had such bad luck‚M-^@M-^Twhat the devil are you doing?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy had shut the door and slipped the bolt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I want something,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You want‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen. I thought you were playing straight, you fellows, or I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have played with you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym willing to take a chance, for that‚M-^@M-^Ys my motto$
+in life, dear lads, but there isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a chance to take when you‚M-^@M-^Yre playing$
+with crooks.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here,‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man, walking over to him and$
+emphasising his words with his forefinger against Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chest, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+kind of stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt amuse me. If you lose your money, lose it like a$
+sportsman and a gentleman, and don‚M-^@M-^Yt squeal.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Boys,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds from you, so step lively.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The suave Mr. Brown, who had been watching the scene with bored eyes,$
+stroking his drooping moustache the while, made a gentle entrance into$
+the conversation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym rather surprised, in fact, I am shocked, Mr. Anderson, that you$
+should take this line,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve lost your money fairly and$
+squarely‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys where you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy pleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling$
+you this. We‚M-^@M-^Yre very near the shore. Somewhere at the back of those$
+warehouses there‚M-^@M-^Ys certain to be a police organisation and a well-paid$
+magistrate. You are going to have a grand opportunity of appearing in$
+the respectable part of the court as a prosecutor, for I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to beat$
+you up‚M-^@M-^Tfirst you,‚M-^@M-^] he pointed to the red-haired Chelwyn, ‚M-^@M-^\and then$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre going to beat me up, are you?‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man and made$
+a quick dive.$
+$
+It was not pretty to watch, unless you took an interest in fighting.$
+They closed for a second and something jolted twice under Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw.$
+He fell back against the cabin partition. He leapt again, but Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+fist met him half-way, and he never really felt what hit him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve won this fight,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I award myself a purse of four$
+hundred pounds. Do you take any interest in these proceedings. Brown?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other man had not moved from his bunk, but now he rose and lifted$
+his dazed companion to his feet.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yd better pay this fellow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll see him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] mumbled the other, but Brown was apparently the$
+brains of the organisation and had merely mentioned his intention of$
+paying out of sheer politeness to his companion.$
+$
+He took a thick pocket-book from his hip pocket and counted out the$
+notes, and Timothy picked them up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll fix you for this,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn, mopping his bleeding lip. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+taken this from me‚M-^@M-^Tnot him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy as he unbolted the door and stepped$
+out.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Some day I‚M-^@M-^Yll get you,‚M-^@M-^] said the livid man, and the finger he pointed$
+at Timothy was shaking with anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He ascended the companion-way feeling remarkably cheerful, and met the$
+purser coming down. That officer regarded him even more suspiciously$
+than ever. But as there were no signs of the fray upon him, the purser$
+went to his cabin relieved, and Timothy passed out to relieve his$
+feelings by the side of the rail. So he sat whilst the big liner was$
+brought alongside the wharf, and then he heard his name spoken and$
+jumped up, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just wanted to tell you, Timothy, in case I did not see you on the$
+train,‚M-^@M-^] she remarked, ‚M-^@M-^\that Mrs. Renfrew has decided not to go back to$
+Bath but to go on to Paris almost immediately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good for Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Bath or Paris will find me$
+hanging around. I nearly came down to you just now to borrow my fare to$
+Bath.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice, ‚M-^@M-^\did you lose all the money you$
+won in Funchal?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy rubbed his nose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt exactly lose it,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I lent it and it has just been$
+repaid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt think it proper your travelling on the same boat.$
+She thinks you ought not to have come to Madeira after me‚M-^@M-^Tus.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was mischief in Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes, in spite of the solemnity of her$
+tone.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about what Mrs. Renfrew thinks,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Why,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre almost as badly off for cousins as I am.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As you are?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any cousins?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hundreds of ‚M-^@M-^Yem,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy glibly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who are they?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, interested.$
+$
+She had reached a stage in their friendship when his relatives were$
+immensely interesting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know their names,‚M-^@M-^] lied Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt give ‚M-^@M-^Yem names but$
+numbers‚M-^@M-^Tone, two, three, four, etc.‚M-^@M-^Tjust at that moment I was thinking$
+of number seventy-nine‚M-^@M-^Tgood morning, Mrs. Renfrew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew was severe and thin, with a yellow face and hooked nose.$
+She was a member of one of the best, if not the best, families in Bath,$
+and it was an unfailing source of pride that she did not know the people$
+that other people knew.$
+$
+Mary watched the encounter with dancing eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I have the pleasure of your company to London?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mrs.$
+Renfrew.$
+$
+She invariably made a point of leaving Mary out, and indeed sustained$
+the pleasant fiction that Mary had no existence on board the ship.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The pleasure will be mine,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I am not travelling with you$
+to London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He said this so innocently that Mrs. Renfrew was in the middle of her$
+next observation before she had any idea that the remark had an$
+offensive interpretation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You seem to have had a very unfortunate experience‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Happily a very hot-looking steward made his appearance at that moment$
+and called Mrs. Renfrew away. She gathered up her charge and with a$
+withering glance at Timothy departed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson, feeling particularly happy, was one of the$
+first to land and strolled along the quay-side waiting within view of$
+the gangway for Mary to disembark. Immediately above him towered the$
+high decks of the _Tigilanes_‚M-^@M-^Ta fact of which he was reminded when,$
+with a crash, a heavy wooden bucket dropped so close to his head that it$
+grazed his shoulder. It was a large bucket, and, dropped from that$
+height, might have caused him considerable physical distress.$
+$
+He looked up.$
+$
+The two card-players with whom he had had some argument were lolling$
+over the rail, their faces turned in quite another direction and talking$
+earnestly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hi!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+They were deaf, it appeared, for they still continued their discussion.$
+A deck hand was passing with a crate load of oranges; one fell out and$
+Timothy picked it up. The attention of Messrs. Chelwyn and Brown was$
+still directed elsewhere, and with a little swing of his arm Timothy$
+sent the orange upon its swift and unerring course. It caught the$
+red-haired man square in the side of the face and burst, and he jumped$
+round with an oath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve dropped your bucket,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sweetly. ‚M-^@M-^\Shall I throw it at$
+you or will you come down and get it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man said something violent, but his companion pulled him away, and$
+Timothy went to look for a seat with peace in his heart.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVII$
+$
+$
+THE train was crowded, but he secured a corner seat in one of the$
+cell-like compartments. It was empty when he entered, but immediately$
+after, to his surprise, Brown and Chelwyn followed him in and deposited$
+their goods upon three seats that they might in the manner of all$
+experienced travellers, occupy breathing space for three at the cost of$
+two tickets.$
+$
+They took no notice of Timothy until the train drew out and he wondered$
+what their game was. It was hardly likely that they would start any$
+rough work with him after their experience of the morning and less$
+likely because these boat trains were well policed.$
+$
+Clear of the Riverside Station the smooth Englishman leant forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you will forget and forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I have nothing to forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown with a smile, ‚M-^@M-^\is very precipitate‚M-^@M-^Twhich$
+means hasty,‚M-^@M-^] he explained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I thought it meant crooked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A spasm contorted the features of Mr. Chelwyn, but he said nothing. As$
+for Brown, he laughed. He laughed heartily but spuriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys not a bad joke,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but to tell you the truth, we mistook$
+you for‚M-^@M-^Tone of us, and my friend and I thought it would be a good joke$
+to get the better of you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was and it wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown, not easily nonplussed. ‚M-^@M-^\Of$
+course, we intended restoring the money to you before you left the$
+ship.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Naturally,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I never thought you would do anything else.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Only you know you rather spoilt our little _esprit_.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If the conversation is to develop in a foreign language,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would only remark: _Honi soit qui mal y pense_,‚M-^@M-^] and the polite Mr.$
+Brown laughed again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You do not mind if my friend and I have a little quiet game by$
+ourselves, if,‚M-^@M-^] he said humorously, ‚M-^@M-^\we swindle one another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I have no objection to watching, but if,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\you should suddenly draw my attention whilst your$
+friend‚M-^@M-^Ys head is turned, to the ease with which I could win a hundred$
+pounds by picking the lady, or discovering the little pea under the$
+little shell, or show me a way of getting rich from any of the other$
+devices which the children of the public schools find so alluring at the$
+country fair, I shall be under the painful necessity of slapping you$
+violently on the wrist.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Thereafter the conversation languished until the train had run through$
+Crewe and was approaching Rugby. It was here that Mr. Brown stopped in$
+the midst of a long, learned discussion on English politics to offer his$
+cigarette-case to Timothy. Timothy chose a cigarette and put it in his$
+pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one of the best Egyptian brands made,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown casually.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Best for you or best for me?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] It was the red-haired Chelwyn who addressed him for the first$
+time. ‚M-^@M-^\What have you to be afraid of? You‚M-^@M-^Yre as scared as a cat! Do you$
+think we want to poison you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Brown produced a flask and poured a modicum of whisky into the cup$
+and handed it to his companion, then he drank himself. Then, without$
+invitation he poured a little more into the cup and offered it to$
+Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let bygones be bygones,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no desire to be a bygone,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I would much rather be$
+a herenow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Nevertheless, he took the cup and smelt it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Butyl chloride,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\has a distinctive odour. I suppose you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+call it by its technical name, and to you it is just vulgarly ‚M-^@M-^Xa$
+knock-out drop.‚M-^@M-^Y Really,‚M-^@M-^] he said, handing back the cup, ‚M-^@M-^\you boys are$
+so elementary. Where did you learn it all‚M-^@M-^Tfrom the movies?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The red-haired man half rose from his seat with a growl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply, and with a jerk of his hand he flung$
+open the carriage door.$
+$
+The men shrank back at the sight of the rapidly running line, and at the$
+certainty of death which awaited any who left the train on that side of$
+the carriage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Start something,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yll undertake to put either one$
+or both of you on to the line. We‚M-^@M-^Yre going at about sixty miles an hour,$
+and a fellow that went out there wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be taking a chance. Now is$
+there going to be a rough house?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Close the door, close the door,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown nervously. ‚M-^@M-^\What a$
+stupid idea, Mr. Anderson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy swung the door to and the man moved up towards him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym just going to put it to you plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said Brown. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve made$
+the voyage out to the Cape and the voyage back and the only mug we met$
+was you. What we won from you just about paid our expenses, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+putting it to you, as a sportsman and a gentleman, that you should let$
+us have half of that stuff back.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The sportsman in me admires your nerve,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I suppose$
+it is the gentleman part that returns an indignant ‚M-^@M-^XNo!‚M-^@M-^Y to your$
+interesting observation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brown turned to his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, that‚M-^@M-^Ys that, Len,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yll just have to let the money$
+go. It is a pity,‚M-^@M-^] he said wistfully and his companion grunted.$
+$
+That ended the conversation so far as the journey was concerned, and$
+Timothy heard no more until he was in the gloomy courtyard at Euston$
+Station and stepping into his taxi.$
+$
+To his surprise it was the red-haired man who approached him, and$
+something in his manner prevented Timothy from taking the action which$
+he otherwise would have thought necessary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here, young fellow,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you watch Brown‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys wild.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not exactly tame,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt take any notice of me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man a little bitterly. ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+engaged in the rough work. I should have got two hundred out of your$
+money‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys what made me so wild. Brown paid all my expenses and gives$
+me ten pound a week and a commission. It sounds funny to you, doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it, but it is the truth,‚M-^@M-^] and somehow Timothy knew that the man was not$
+lying.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys finished with me‚M-^@M-^Tsays I am a hoodoo,‚M-^@M-^] said the little man. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve got out of five weeks‚M-^@M-^Y work? Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand and disclosed two ten-pound notes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys dangerous,‚M-^@M-^] he warned Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you make any mistake$
+about that. I was only wild because I was losing my money, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys wild$
+because you‚M-^@M-^Yve got fresh with him and caught him out every time. Good$
+night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He felt in his pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying, it is a plausible lie and one that pleases me,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\This will salve my conscience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped two notes into the man‚M-^@M-^Ys hands.$
+$
+Chelwyn was speechless for a moment. Then he asked:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And where are you staying in London, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel,‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll remember that. I$
+shall hear if anything is going on and I‚M-^@M-^Yll ‚M-^@M-^Yphone you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+gentleman, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So Mr. Brown said,‚M-^@M-^] remarked Timothy and drove off, feeling unusually$
+cheerful.$
+$
+If Timothy could be cheerful under the depressing conditions which$
+prevailed on the night of his arrival in London, he was a veritable$
+pattern of cheer. A drizzling rain was falling as the taxi squeaked its$
+way through a labyrinth of mean streets. He had glimpses of$
+wretched-looking people, grotesque of shape and unreal, through the$
+rain-blurred window of the cab.$
+$
+Then suddenly the character of the streets changed, and he was in a$
+broad street twinkling with light. There was a glimpse of trees, wide$
+open spaces, dotted with light. The street grew busier and the traffic$
+thicker, then suddenly the cab turned again into semi-darkness and$
+pulled up before the hotel.$
+$
+A porter opened the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do I think of Madeira?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy of the astonished man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had time to think. Will I be staying long in London? No. What$
+are my opinions of the political crisis which has arisen in my absence?$
+I would rather not say.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It takes a great deal to upset the equilibrium of a well-conducted hall$
+man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you booked your room?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Timothy meekly admitted that he had.$
+$
+He woke to a London much more beautiful, to a vista of old-world$
+buildings such as Cruikshank loved to draw, to a green square and$
+glimpses of greener trees.$
+$
+Mary was staying at the Carlton, but he had arranged to meet her for$
+lunch. He had not arranged to meet her dragon, but he knew she would be$
+there. He had breakfasted, and was on the point of leaving the hotel,$
+when Chelwyn came.$
+$
+To say that Timothy regretted his generosity of the night before would$
+be to do him an injustice. Nevertheless, he had some misgivings as to$
+whether he had not been a little too generous. The appearance of Mr.$
+Chelwyn, early in the morning, looking so spruce and confident, was in$
+itself a suspicious happening, though events proved that the suspicion$
+was unfounded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you alone for a moment, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^] asked the red-haired$
+man.$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come along to the drawing-room,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+It was the one public room which would be empty at that time of the$
+morning. Mr. Chelwyn deposited his hat and stick and brand-new yellow$
+gloves before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mr. Anderson, I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell you a few facts which will$
+surprise you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had a gold brick sent to you by your Uncle George in$
+Alaska, have you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy dubiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Because I‚M-^@M-^Ym not buying that$
+kind of fact.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man smiled and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is hardly likely I should try that stuff on you, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No,$
+this is a much more serious matter. Before I go any farther I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell$
+you that I am not asking for money. I am grateful to you for what you$
+did to me last night, Mr. Anderson. A crook has a wife and children the$
+same as anybody else. I have been in this funny business for ten years,$
+but now I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of it for good.‚M-^@M-^] He looked round and dropped his voice,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson, I told you last night that we‚M-^@M-^Yve been five or six weeks$
+away from England. Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt that sound strange to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is because you don‚M-^@M-^Yt know the game,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\As a rule,$
+when we‚M-^@M-^Yre working these liners, we go out to Cape Town and come back by$
+the next ship that sails. What do you think we stayed at Funchal$
+for‚M-^@M-^Tthere‚M-^@M-^Ys no money in short voyages‚M-^@M-^Tit‚M-^@M-^Ys all on the long run from$
+Madeira to Cape Town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt the slightest idea,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy wearily. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt even$
+remember seeing you in Funchal‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We laid low,‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That may be, but if you‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell me the interesting story of$
+your life, Ginger, I beg that you will cut it short‚M-^@M-^Tthe history, I$
+mean, not necessarily your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell it to you as quickly as possible,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt always work with Brown. In fact, I‚M-^@M-^Yve only worked with him about$
+three times before. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man with the broads‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The broads?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\With the cards,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I say that I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man$
+with the broads as some of the others. I‚M-^@M-^Yve got a bit of a reputation$
+for scrapping. I‚M-^@M-^Yve never left a pal in the lurch and I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been$
+ready for any ‚M-^@M-^Xrough house‚M-^@M-^Y that came along. About two months ago Brown$
+sent for me‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got a flat off Piccadilly and lives like a lord. He$
+told me he was going to Madeira on a special job, that he‚M-^@M-^Yd been$
+employed by a lady in Paris‚M-^@M-^Ta Madame Serpilot (you‚M-^@M-^Yd better write that$
+down in your pocket-book)‚M-^@M-^Tto shepherd a young lady who was coming over.$
+Mind you, there was no harm intended to the young lady, but the general$
+idea was that she might be accompanied by a man, and he was the fellow$
+who had to be looked after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was the lady‚M-^@M-^Ys name?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man without hesitation, ‚M-^@M-^\and you were the fellow$
+we were asked to put out of business. Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys idea was to break you;$
+then, when you got to London, one of his pals would have met you and$
+offered to lend you money. They‚M-^@M-^Yd have framed up a charge against you of$
+obtaining money by false pretences, and you would have been pinched.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys eyebrows rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Was this Mrs. Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys plan?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, but the man shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir, she gave just the details to Brown. She never said what was to$
+be done to you, according to him, but you were to be stopped going$
+around with the young lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you‚M-^@M-^Yve got me,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe she‚M-^@M-^Ys an old widow, but$
+Brown never told me much about her. He got instructions from her while$
+he was in Paris, but I never discovered how. I went to Madeira with him$
+because he knew I was tough‚M-^@M-^Tbut I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt tough enough,‚M-^@M-^] he added with a$
+dry smile.$
+$
+Timothy held out his hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ginger,‚M-^@M-^] he said solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\please forgive the orange!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mind that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\that‚M-^@M-^Ys all in the day‚M-^@M-^Ys work.$
+It made me a bit wild, and my eye‚M-^@M-^Ys feeling sore, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that$
+worry you. What you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to do now is to look out for Brown, because$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll have you as sure as death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll look out for Madame Serpilot, too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I think I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+to Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys not in Paris now, I can tell you that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\The wire$
+Brown got at Liverpool was from Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\is even more attractive than Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                             CHAPTER XVIII$
+$
+$
+CHELWYN left Timothy with something to think about. Who was Madame$
+Serpilot, this old lady who had such an interest in Mary travelling$
+alone? And why, oh! why had she left Paris for Monte Carlo at the fag$
+end of the season? For he and Mary had privately decided between them$
+that London and Paris should only be stopping places on the route to the$
+Riviera. Why should Madame Serpilot have changed her plans at the same$
+time? There was something more than a coincidence in this. At lunch-time$
+he had Mary to herself, her chaperon having a headache.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\can you tell me why we changed our plans on the boat$
+and decided to go straight on to Monte Carlo instead of staying in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said readily. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember my telling you about those$
+beautiful books of views that I saw on the ship?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where did you see them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I found them in my cabin one day. I think the steward must have left$
+them,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\They were most wonderful productions, full of coloured$
+prints and photographs‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt I tell you about them?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I remember,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\Found them in your cabin, eh? Well,$
+nobody left any beautiful or attractive pictures of Monte Carlo in my$
+berth, but I think that won‚M-^@M-^Yt stop me going on to Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was an opportunity she had been seeking for a week and she seized it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want to ask you something, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew told me$
+the other day that they call you ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson. Why is that,$
+Timothy?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because I take a chance, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been taking$
+chances all my life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not a gambler, Timothy, are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked gravely. ‚M-^@M-^\I know you$
+bet and play cards, but men do that for amusement, and somehow it is all$
+right. But when men start out to make a living, and actually make a$
+living, by games of chance, they somehow belong to another life and$
+another people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was silent.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre just too good to go that way, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she went on. ‚M-^@M-^\There are$
+lots of chances that a man can take in this world, in matching his$
+brains, his strength and his skill against other men, and when he wins$
+his stake is safe. He doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose it the next day or the next month,$
+and he‚M-^@M-^Ys picking winners all the time, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His first inclination was to be nettled. She was wounding the tender$
+skin of his vanity, and he was startled to discover how tender a skin$
+that was. All that she said was true and less than true. She could not$
+guess how far his mind and inclination were from commonplace labour and$
+how very little work came into the calculations of his future. He looked$
+upon a job as a thing not to be held and developed into something$
+better, but as a stopgap between two successful chances. He was almost$
+shocked when this truth came home to him. The girl was nervous, and$
+painfully anxious not to hurt him, and yet well aware that she was$
+rubbing a sore place.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, for your sake, as well as for mine, for you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of$
+mine, I want to be proud of you, to see you past this present phase of$
+life. Mrs. Renfrew speaks of you as a gambler, and says your name, even$
+at your age, is well known as one who would rather bet than buy. That$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt true, Timothy, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She put her hand on his and looked into his face. He did not meet her$
+eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that is true, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said steadily. ‚M-^@M-^\How it comes to be$
+true, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite know. I suppose I have drifted a little over the$
+line, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym grateful to you for pulling me up. Oh, no, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt regret$
+the past‚M-^@M-^Tit has all been useful‚M-^@M-^Tand I have made good on chances, but I$
+see there are other chances that a man can take than putting his money$
+on the pace of a horse or backing against zero. Maybe, when I get back$
+to London I‚M-^@M-^Yll settle down into a respectable citizen and keep hens or$
+something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was speaking seriously, though at first she thought he was being$
+sarcastic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you won‚M-^@M-^Yt gamble again?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He hesitated to reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I mean it isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair of me to ask$
+you. It is almost cruel,‚M-^@M-^] she smiled, ‚M-^@M-^\to let you go to Monte Carlo and$
+ask you not to put money on the tables. But promise me, Timothy, that$
+when I tell you to stop playing, you will stop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here‚M-^@M-^Ys my hand on it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, brightening up already at the$
+prospect of being allowed to gamble at all. ‚M-^@M-^\Hereafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He raised$
+his hand solemnly. ‚M-^@M-^\By the way,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, ‚M-^@M-^\do you know a lady named$
+Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I do not,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have never heard the name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have no relations or friends in France?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] she replied immediately.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What made you go to France at all?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\When I heard from you,$
+Mary, you talked about taking a holiday in Madeira before setting up$
+house in Bath, and the first thing I knew of your intention to go abroad$
+again was the letter you sent me just before I started for Madeira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wanted to go a year ago, after Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\then$
+Mrs. Renfrew couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt take the trip‚M-^@M-^Tone of her younger children had$
+measles.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has that woman children?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in an awed voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be absurd. Of course she has children. It was she who decided on$
+making the trip. She writes little articles in the _Bath County$
+Herald_‚M-^@M-^Ta local paper‚M-^@M-^Ton the care of children and all that sort of$
+thing. She‚M-^@M-^Ys not really a journalist, she is literary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\sometimes they write poetry, sometimes recipes$
+for ice cream‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xtake three cups of flour, a pint of cream in which an$
+egg has been boiled and a pinch of vanilla‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled. Evidently Timothy had hit upon the particular brand of$
+journalism to which Mrs. Renfrew was addicted.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\there was to have been a sort of Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Welfare Meeting in Paris next week‚M-^@M-^Tan International affair‚M-^@M-^Tand when we$
+were in Madeira she received an invitation to attend with a free return$
+ticket‚M-^@M-^Twasn‚M-^@M-^Yt that splendid?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Splendid,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy absently. ‚M-^@M-^\Naturally you thought it was an$
+excellent opportunity to go also.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And now you have arrived here you find that the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Meeting has been postponed for ten years?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you know that the meeting had been postponed?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I guessed it,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\such things have happened before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The truth is,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\nobody knows anything about this$
+meeting, and the letter which Mrs. Renfrew sent to the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Society in Paris was waiting for us when we arrived at the Carlton. It$
+had been returned‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XAddressee Unknown.‚M-^@M-^Y Mrs. Renfrew had put the Carlton$
+address inside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was ample excuse for speculation of an innocuous kind. Mrs. Renfrew$
+had been approached because it was known by this mysterious somebody$
+that she would take the girl with her, and this sinister somebody had$
+hired two thugs to shepherd her from Madeira and to put Timothy out of$
+action, should he decide to accompany the party to France. The situation$
+was distinctly interesting.$
+$
+Three days later the party crossed the Channel. Timothy had high hopes$
+of adventure, which were fated to be more than fulfilled. They stayed$
+three days in Paris and he had the time of his life. He went to the$
+races at Maisons Lafitte, and came back glowing with a sense of his$
+virtue, for he had not made a bet. He drifted in to the baccara rooms at$
+Enghien, watched tens of thousands of francs change hands, and returned$
+to Paris that night with a halo fitted by Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys own hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre really wonderful, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you are$
+allowed one final flutter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym saving that up for Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+Since his arrival in Paris he had lost the right to his name, for he was$
+taking no chances. If he went abroad at night he kept to the brilliantly$
+illuminated boulevards or the crowded caf√©s. He kept clear of the$
+crowds‚M-^@M-^Tespecially crowds which formed quickly and for no apparent$
+reason.$
+$
+He was taking no chances because he felt it was not fair upon the$
+particular genius who presided over his destinies that he should$
+squander his luck in a miraculous escape from death or disablement. Only$
+once, when dining at the Scribe, did he think he saw the familiar face$
+of Mr. Brown. With an apology he left the two ladies and made his way$
+with difficulty through the crowded restaurant, only to find that his$
+man had disappeared.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\These caf√©s have as many doors as a trick-scene,‚M-^@M-^] he grumbled when he$
+came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you see a friend of yours?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not so much a friend as one who has a financial interest in me,‚M-^@M-^]$
+replied Timothy.$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew had thawed a little under the beneficent influences of$
+Paris. She was busy sending off picture-postcards and had written to$
+Bath her first impression of the French capital to the extent of three$
+columns. She had also written a poem which began: ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, city of light$
+that shines so bright,‚M-^@M-^] and went on rhyming ‚M-^@M-^\vain‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\Seine,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\gay‚M-^@M-^]$
+with ‚M-^@M-^\play,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\joy‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\alloy,‚M-^@M-^] through twenty-three stanzas.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I rather pride myself,‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew, ‚M-^@M-^\upon that description of$
+Paris‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xthe city of light.‚M-^@M-^Y Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think it is very original, Mr.$
+Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically. ‚M-^@M-^\Parisians have called it the$
+‚M-^@M-^XVille Lumi√®re‚M-^@M-^Y for about two hundred years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys almost the same, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew. ‚M-^@M-^\How clever the$
+French are!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew did not speak French and took a more generous view of the$
+young man when she discovered that he did. It fell to Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys lot to$
+order tickets, arrange cabs, pay bills and act as unofficial courier to$
+the party. He was anxious to be gone from Paris, impatient for the big$
+game to begin. For some reason, he did not anticipate that any harm$
+would come to the girl. This struck him as strange later, but at the$
+moment all his thoughts were centred upon the match between himself and$
+this old French lady who had set herself out to separate him from Mary$
+Maxell.$
+$
+No unpleasant incident‚M-^@M-^Tthe crowded condition of the dining-car$
+excepted‚M-^@M-^Tmarred the journey to Monte Carlo. There was the inevitable$
+night spent in a stuffy sleeping-berth in a car that rocked and swayed$
+to such an extent that Timothy expected it to jump the line, as$
+thousands of other passengers have expected it to do; and they came with$
+the morning to the Valley of the Rhone, a wide, blue, white-flecked$
+stream flowing between gaunt hills, past solitary ch√¢teaux and strange$
+walled towns, which looked as if they had been kept under glass cases$
+for centuries, that the modern world should be reminded of the dangers$
+under which our forefathers lived. So to Marseilles, and a long, hot and$
+slow journey to Nice.$
+$
+To the girl it was a pilgrimage of joy. She would not have missed a$
+single moment of that ride. The blue sea, the white villas with their$
+green jalousies, the banked roses over wall and pergola and the$
+warm-scented breeze, and above all the semi-tropical sun, placed her in$
+a new world, a wonder world more beautiful than imagination had painted.$
+$
+There is something about Monte Carlo which is very satisfying. It is so$
+orderly, so clean, so white and bright, that you have the impression$
+that it is carefully dusted every morning and that the villas on the$
+hills are taken down weekly by tender hands, polished and replaced.$
+$
+There is nothing garish about Monte Carlo, for all its stucco and$
+plaster. Some of the buildings, and particularly the Casino, were$
+compared by the irreverent Timothy to the White City, but it was a$
+refined White City and the Casino itself, with its glass-roofed porch,$
+its great, solemn hanging lamps and its decorous uniformed attendants,$
+had something of the air of a National Bank.$
+$
+Timothy took a room at the H√¥tel de Paris, where the girl was staying,$
+and lost no time in seeking information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge. ‚M-^@M-^\There is a madame who bears that$
+name, I think, but she is not staying here, monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of whom should I inquire, I pray you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in the vernacular.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of the Municipal Council, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge, ‚M-^@M-^\or, if the$
+madame is a wealthy madame, of the manager of the Credit Lyonnais, who$
+will perhaps inform monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thanks many times,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He went first to the Credit Lyonnais, and found the manager extremely$
+polite but uncommunicative. It was not the practice of the bank, he$
+said, to disclose the addresses of their clients. He would not say that$
+Madame Serpilot was his client, but if she were, he could certainly not$
+give her address to any unauthorised person. From this Timothy gathered$
+that Madame Serpilot was a client. He went on to the Mairie and met with$
+better fortune. The Mairie had no respect for persons. It was there to$
+supply information and what the Mairie of Monte Carlo does not know$
+about Monaco, the cleverest detective force in the world would be$
+wasting its time trying to discover.$
+$
+Madame Serpilot lived at the Villa Condamine. The Villa Condamine was$
+not, as the name suggested, in the poorer part of Monte Carlo but in$
+that most exclusive territory, the tiny peninsula of Cap Martin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has madam been a resident long?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For one hundred and twenty-nine days,‚M-^@M-^] replied the official promptly.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame hired the villa furnished from the agent, of the Grand Duchess$
+Eleana who, alas! was destroyed in that terrible revolution.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He gave Timothy some details of the family from which the Grand Duchess$
+had sprung, the amount of her income in pre-war days, and was passing to$
+her eccentricities when Timothy took his departure. He was not$
+interested in the Grand Duchess Eleana, alive or dead.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIX$
+$
+$
+HE went to the house agent on the main street and from him procured$
+the exact position of Madame Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys residence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\An old madame?‚M-^@M-^] said the agent. ‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur, I cannot say that she is$
+old. And I cannot say that she is young.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He thought a moment, as though endeavouring to find some reason for this$
+reticence on the subject of her age, and then added:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have not seen her. Madame is a widow,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Alas! there are$
+so many in France as the result of the terrible war.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then she is young,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\They didn‚M-^@M-^Yt send old men to the$
+front.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may be young,‚M-^@M-^] replied the agent, ‚M-^@M-^\or she may be old. One does not$
+know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the assistant who had shown the lady the house and had taken$
+the documents for her to sign. The assistant was aged sixteen, and at$
+the age of sixteen most people above twenty are listed amongst the aged.$
+He was certain she was a widow and very feeble, because she walked with$
+a stick. She always wore a heavy black veil, even when she was in the$
+garden.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it not natural,‚M-^@M-^] said the house agent romantically, ‚M-^@M-^\that the madame$
+who has lost all that makes life worth living should no longer desire$
+the world to look upon her face?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It may be natural in Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not natural$
+in London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He located the house on a large plan which the obliging agent produced,$
+and went back to the hotel, firmly resolved to take the first$
+opportunity of calling on Madame Serpilot and discovering what object$
+she had in view when she arranged to endanger his young life.$
+$
+Mary was waiting for him, a little impatiently for one who had such a$
+horror of gambling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have to get tickets at the Bureau,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\and the concierge$
+says we must have special membership cards for the Cercle Priv√©e.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The tickets were easy to procure, and they passed into the great saloon$
+where, around five tables, stood silent ovals of humanity. The scene was$
+a weird one to Timothy and fascinating too. Besides this, all the other$
+gambling games in the world, all the roulette tables and baccara$
+outfits, were crude and amateurish. The eight croupiers who sat at each$
+table in their black frock coats and their black ties, solemn visaged,$
+unemotional, might have been deacons in committee. The click of rakes$
+against chips, the whirr of the twirling ball, the monotonous sing-song$
+announcement of the chief croupier‚M-^@M-^Tit was a ritual and a business at$
+one and the same time.$
+$
+It was amazing to reflect that, year in and year out, from ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock$
+in the morning until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock at night (until midnight in the Cercle$
+Priv√©e) these black-coated men sat at their tables, twirling their$
+rakes, watching without error every note or counter that fell on the$
+table, separating notes from chips with a deftness that was amazing,$
+doing this in such an atmosphere of respectability that the most rabid$
+anti-gambler watching the scene must come in time to believe that$
+roulette was a legitimate business exercise.$
+$
+Through the years this fringe of people about the table would remain,$
+though units would go out, and as units went out new units would replace$
+them, and everlastingly would sit shabby old men and women with their$
+cryptic notebooks, making their tableaux with red and black pencils,$
+religiously recording the result of every coup, staking now and again$
+their five-franc pieces, and watching them raked to the croupier with$
+stony despair or drawing with trembling hands the few poor francs which$
+fortune had sent them.$
+$
+Timothy was very silent when they passed the portals of the Cercle$
+Priv√©e, into that wonderful interior which, viewed from the entrance$
+room, had the appearance of some rich cathedral.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you think of them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mary.$
+$
+He did not answer at once.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did you think of the people?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded again. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you see$
+that quaint old woman‚M-^@M-^Ttaking a chance? I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+really didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and sighed.$
+$
+The roulette table did not attract him. He strolled off to watch the$
+players at _trente et quarante_. Here the procedure was more$
+complicated. One of the officials dealt two lines of cards, ending each$
+when the pips added to something over thirty. The top line stood for$
+black, the lower line for red, and that which was nearest to thirty won.$
+After mastering this, the process was simple; you could either back the$
+red or the black, or you could bet that the first card that was dealt$
+was identical with the colour that won, or was the reverse.$
+$
+The game interested him. It had certain features which in a way were$
+fascinating. He noticed that the croupier never spoke of the black. The$
+black might have had no existence at the _trente et quarante_ table;$
+either ‚M-^@M-^\red won‚M-^@M-^] or ‚M-^@M-^\red lost.‚M-^@M-^] He staked a louis and won twice. He$
+staked another and lost it. Then he won three coups of a louis and$
+looked around uncertainly, almost guiltily, for Mary.$
+$
+She was watching the roulette players, and Timothy took a wad of bills$
+from his pocket and counted out six milles. That was another thing he$
+was to discover: there were three classes of players‚M-^@M-^Tthose who punted$
+in one or five louis pieces, those who bet handsomely in milles (a$
+thousand-franc note is a ‚M-^@M-^\mille‚M-^@M-^] and has no other name), and those who$
+went the maximum of twelve thousand francs on each coup.$
+$
+Money had no value. He threw six thousand down to the croupier and$
+received in exchange six oblong plaques like thin cakes of blue soap. He$
+put a thousand francs on the black and lost it. He looked round$
+apprehensively for Mary, but she was still intent upon the roulette$
+players. He ventured another thousand, and lost that too. A young$
+Englishman sitting at the table looked up with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre betting against the tableau,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The table is running red$
+to-night. Look!‚M-^@M-^] He showed a little notebook ruled into divisions, and$
+long lines of dots, one under the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all these$
+are reds. The table has only swung across to black twice for any run,$
+and then it was only a run of four. If you bet against the table you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+go broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At any other place than at the tables at Monte Carlo advice of this$
+character, and intimate references to financial possibilities, would be$
+resented. But the Rooms, like the grave, level all the players, who are$
+a great family banded together in an unrecognised brotherhood for the$
+destruction of a common enemy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance against the table,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I shall go$
+broke, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman laughed.$
+$
+The four thousand francs he had left went the same way as their friends$
+and Timothy changed another six thousand and threw two on the black.$
+Then, acting on the impulse of the moment, he threw down the remaining$
+four.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned at the shocked voice and Mary was standing behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you gamble like that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He tried to smile, but produced a grimace.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, it is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is only francs, and francs aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+real money, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She turned and walked away and he followed. The Englishman, twisting$
+round in his chair, said something. Timothy thought he was asking$
+whether he should look after his money and answered ‚M-^@M-^\Certainly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl walked to one of the padded benches by the wall and sat down.$
+There was such real trouble in her face that Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys heart sank.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is my last fling and you told me I$
+could have it. After to-night I cut out everything that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt qualify$
+for the ‚M-^@M-^Xearned income‚M-^@M-^Y column of the tax-surveyor.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt the amount of money you were$
+venturing, but there was something in your face which made me feel‚M-^@M-^Twhy!$
+I just felt sick,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary!‚M-^@M-^] he said in surprise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know I‚M-^@M-^Ym being unreasonable,‚M-^@M-^] she interrupted, ‚M-^@M-^\but Timothy, I‚M-^@M-^TI$
+just don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to think of you like this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked into his dejected face and the softest light that ever shone$
+in woman‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes was in hers.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said, half in jest, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yre paying the penalty for$
+having a girl friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying the penalty for being a loafer,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily. ‚M-^@M-^\I think$
+there must be some bad blood in us. Mary, I know what I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and took one of her hands. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing the right to love you,$
+dearest.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a queer place for such a confession, and in her wildest dreams$
+the girl never imagined that the first word of love spoken to her by any$
+man would come in a gambling saloon at Monte Carlo. Above her where she$
+sat was the great canvas of the Florentine Graces; half nude reliefs on$
+the ceiling dangled glittering chains of light and over all sounded the$
+monotonous voice of the croupier:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tet couleur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The young Englishman at the table turned round with an inquiring lift of$
+his eyebrows, and Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wants to know if I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and honestly$
+Mary, I am. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going back to London when this trip‚M-^@M-^Ys over, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going to start at the bottom and work up.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to lie to you, or pretend any longer. I just love you,$
+Mary, and if you‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for me, I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good. I have been a gambler,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\a poor, low gambler, and all the time I‚M-^@M-^Yve thought I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+clever! I‚M-^@M-^Yve been going round puffed up with my own self-importance, and$
+my head‚M-^@M-^Ys been so much in the air that I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt seen just where my feet$
+were leading me,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\This sounds like the sort of thing you$
+get at the Salvation Army penitent form,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I‚M-^@M-^Ym straight and$
+sincere.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you are, Timothy, but you needn‚M-^@M-^Yt start at the bottom. I have my$
+money‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop where you are, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\Not a penny would I take$
+from you, darling.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did they ring that bell for?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+It was the second time the tinkle of sound had come from the croupier at$
+the _trente et quarante_ table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Heaven knows!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe it is to call the other$
+worshippers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the young Englishman looked round and said something.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he say?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He said seventeen,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Was that the number you backed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no numbers on that table except No. 1‚M-^@M-^Tand No. 1 is the fat$
+man with the rake‚M-^@M-^The gets it coming and going. Mary, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to ask$
+you one question: If I make good will you marry me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was silent and again the voice of the croupier came:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tcouleur gagne.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What does ‚M-^@M-^Xrouge perd‚M-^@M-^Y mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked. ‚M-^@M-^\He has said that ever so many$
+times.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means ‚M-^@M-^Xblack wins,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does black always win?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not always,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe he‚M-^@M-^Ys only saying that to lure$
+me back to the table. Mary, what do you say?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and to the scandal of the one attendant who was$
+watching them he bent forward and kissed her.$
+$
+A terrible act this, for the gold-laced and liveried footman, who came$
+with slow, majestic steps to where they sat.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\this is not done.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked up at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Chassez-vous_,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly.$
+$
+It was startling French, but it was the nearest he could get at the$
+moment to ‚M-^@M-^\chase yourself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the bell tinkled, and the young Englishman rose, thrust a small$
+packet of money into his pocket and came toward them, bearing what$
+looked to be a large book without covers. His face was a little haggard$
+and the perspiration stood upon his forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is getting on my nerves, old man. You had better play yourself,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, and he handed the book to Timothy, and Timothy looked vaguely$
+from his hands to the hot Englishman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys this?‚M-^@M-^] he croaked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A run of twenty-eight on the black,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+phenomenal! You wanted me to go on, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you? I asked you whether I$
+should play your thousand francs. The bank bust four times‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+hear them ring for more money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded. He had no words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, your six went to twelve and I left the maximum run,‚M-^@M-^] the$
+Englishman said. ‚M-^@M-^\I asked you if that was right and you nodded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I nodded,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy mechanically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve won twenty-seven and a half maximums.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at the money in his hand, looked up at the ceiling and$
+gulped something down.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] he gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\I am obliged to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was inadequate, but it was all that he could say.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\I won a lot of money myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a great hand at arithmetic,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\will you tell me$
+how many pounds twenty-seven and a half maximums make?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a remarkable situation. Somebody should have laughed, but they$
+were all too serious, the girl as serious as Timothy, and the young$
+Englishman scrawling calculations on a loose page of his notebook.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thirty-five francs to a pound,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\makes ¬£340 a coup.$
+Twenty-seven and a half is about‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and he gripped the other‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and wrung it.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you, fairy godmother‚M-^@M-^TI don‚M-^@M-^Yt know your other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They stood together watching his lanky figure, as he, wholly unconscious$
+of the providential part he had played, moved down to the roulette$
+table, eyeing the game with the air of superiority which every player of$
+_trente et quarante_ has for a game with a paltry maximum of six$
+thousand francs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] whispered the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it wonderful?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He put the money into his pocket and it bulged untidily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do with it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Give it to the poor,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, taking her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the poor?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was wondering whether his fortune had driven him mad.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The poor,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly, ‚M-^@M-^\money won by gambling‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense,‚M-^@M-^] she broke in, ‚M-^@M-^\to what poor are you giving it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To poor Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] said he. ‚M-^@M-^\Let us dash madly to the bar and drink$
+orangeade.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XX$
+$
+$
+THE band was playing one of de Courville‚M-^@M-^Ys new revue tunes, and the$
+Caf√© de Paris was crowded out. There had been a big influx of visitors$
+from Nice, and Monte Carlo presented an appearance comparable with the$
+height of the season. Mrs. Renfrew had motored up to La Turbie, and a$
+bank of cloud having descended upon the mountain made the road$
+dangerous. (Those who have journeyed from the Corniche to Monte Carlo by$
+night will appreciate just how dangerous is that road.) She had,$
+therefore, elected to spend the night at the hotel on the top of the$
+hill.$
+$
+This information she had telephoned to the girl on the night following$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys great win, and had added that she could see ‚M-^@M-^\the twinkling$
+lights of Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^] and that ‚M-^@M-^\the misty spaces of ocean filled her$
+with strange unrest,‚M-^@M-^] which observation had been repeated to the$
+unsympathetic Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It must be awful to have a mind like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and then, ‚M-^@M-^\Mary,$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve been a long time waiting to exchange confidences about cousins.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no confidences to give you about Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary with a$
+smile, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have been on the point of telling me about your cousin$
+so often that I feel a little curious.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The story he had to tell was not a nice one. It meant opening old wounds$
+and reviving sad memories, but it had to be done. She was not so shocked$
+as he had expected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have not told me anything new,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\You see, all$
+along I have known that the ‚M-^@M-^XA.C.‚M-^@M-^Y in your name stood for ‚M-^@M-^XAlfred$
+Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^Y and once uncle told me that he had known a relative of$
+yours, and I guessed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly she demanded:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think Cartwright is in Europe?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am certain. That is, if Morocco is in Europe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have had$
+it in the back of my mind ever since the crime was committed that that$
+is the place he would make for. You see, in the few minutes I had with$
+him he told me, perhaps not the whole of the story, but at any rate his$
+version. He knows Morocco and has been there before. He spoke about a$
+Moorish chief named El Mograb, who wanted him to stay with the tribe,$
+and he told me he was sorry he had not followed the Moor‚M-^@M-^Ys advice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell the police that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did not tell the police very much about that visit. Cartwright$
+revived his accusations against Sir John. It meant digging up these$
+charges, and that is what I did not wish to do, for‚M-^@M-^Tfor‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For my sake?‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys about the size of it,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+A little stream of diners were leaving the restaurant, moving slowly$
+down the narrow aisle between the tables, and Timothy stopped talking as$
+they passed and eyed them with a bored interest usual to the$
+circumstances.$
+$
+It was after the interruption had ended, and the last of the little$
+stream had departed, that he saw the card on the table. It was near his$
+place and it had not been there before. He picked it up and on the$
+uppermost side was written: ‚M-^@M-^\Do not let your friend see this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began, and turned the card over.$
+$
+It was not written but printed in capital letters:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM ME BY THE TWENTY-NINTH, I BEG OF YOU$
+    THAT YOU WILL GO TO TANGIER AND ENQUIRE AT THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL$
+    FOR A MAN CALLED RAHBAT‚M-^@M-^TA MOOR, WHO WILL LEAD YOU TO ME. I BEG$
+    YOU FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO COME. DID YOU GET THE$
+    MONEY?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy laid the card down and stared at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and reached out her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Tit is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense, Timothy. What is it? Let me see it, please.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Without a word he handed the card to the girl, who read it through in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is that from?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, ‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Obviously,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the reference to the money and the appeal to our$
+relationship‚M-^@M-^Tbut how did it get there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the head waiter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who were those people who went out just now?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They are very well known,‚M-^@M-^] explained the head waiter. ‚M-^@M-^\There was a$
+monsieur, a London theatrical manager, and a madame who was his wife.$
+There was another monsieur, an American writer, and an English monsieur$
+who was in the employment as secretary to a madame who lives at Cap$
+Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, that is the name. She is a widow, _h√©las_! but immensely rich!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy put the card into his pocket. He had said nothing to the girl$
+about Madame Serpilot since they had left London, and for the first time$
+he had some misgivings as to her safety. Yet in truth that sixth sense$
+of his, which had hitherto worked so to his advantage, offered him no$
+warning that the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys happiness was threatened. He was sure that$
+whatever danger the situation held was danger to him personally. He had$
+not seen the English monsieur who was secretary to Madame Serpilot, but$
+then his back had been toward the far end of the room from whence the$
+man came and he had presented no other view than the back of his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a message from Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am going to get to$
+the bottom of this story if I stay in Monte Carlo for the rest of my$
+life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw Mary back to her hotel, went to his room and changed, and just as$
+the Casino was disgorging its tired clients, he walked through the$
+palm-shaded avenue that led to the main road and began his tramp to Cap$
+Martin. To discover a house in this area by daylight, with the aid of a$
+plan, might have been a simple matter‚M-^@M-^Tby night it presented almost$
+insuperable difficulties.$
+$
+Cap Martin is a promontory of hill and pine and wild flower. Its roads$
+run at the will of its wealthy residents, and there are lanes and paths$
+and broad roads which are not really broad roads at all, but the private$
+entrances to the wonderful villas in which the district abounds, and the$
+grey light was in the eastern sky when Timothy finally located the Villa$
+Condamine.$
+$
+It stood on the edge of the sea, surrounded on the land side by a high$
+wall, though if its owner sought seclusion the woods which surrounded$
+the villa were sufficient.$
+$
+Timothy worked round a little bay until he commanded a view of the place$
+from the sea. A zig-zag path led down from the house to the seashore,$
+terminating in a little concrete quay. Presently he heard the sound of$
+footsteps and a Monogasque workman, in blue overalls, came slouching$
+along the shore path, pipe in mouth.$
+$
+He bade the young man a cheery good morning and stopped, in the friendly$
+way of the Monogasques, to talk. He was a gardener on his way to the$
+villa. He could be on his way to nowhere else, for the rough path on$
+which Timothy stood led straight to a door in the high wall. It was a$
+good job, but he wished he lived nearer. But then, none of madame‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+servants slept in the house, and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! _voil√†!_ It is the Moor!‚M-^@M-^] and he pointed out to sea.$
+$
+A tiny steam yacht was coming slowly to land‚M-^@M-^TTimothy had seen its$
+lights for an hour‚M-^@M-^Tand was steaming now to its anchorage, leaving the$
+line of its wake on the smooth surface of the water.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Moor!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quickly, and then carelessly, ‚M-^@M-^\Has any Moor a$
+villa here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is a great Moor who sometimes$
+comes here from Morocco. A long journey, monsieur. It is five days‚M-^@M-^Y$
+voyage from the Moorish coast‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does he come to the Villa Condamine?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\He is a friend of the madame, and twice has he$
+been there in three months.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was a little splash of water under the bow of the yacht, when the$
+anchor was dropped, and presently a boat drew away and in the stern$
+sheets was a figure muffled in a white jellab.$
+$
+Timothy looked after the retreating figure of the gardener, who was$
+leisurely pursuing his way, and, turning, followed him. It was unlikely$
+that the mysterious madame would allow a humble workman to have the key$
+of the garden gate, yet to his surprise this was the case. The man$
+opened the gate and waited, looking round as if he expected somebody.$
+Timothy guessed that there were two or more workmen and that this$
+particular man had the key and admitted the lot. In this surmise he$
+proved to be right. Presently yet another blue-bloused gardener$
+appeared, and the two stood together waiting for a third. He made no$
+appearance, and the two men passed through the door and pulled it close$
+behind them.$
+$
+Timothy quickened his pace. As he had thought, the door was left ajar$
+for the third man. He pushed it open gently, but saw nothing but the end$
+of a twisting path, which disappeared between high hedges of lilac.$
+$
+If ever there was a time to take a chance it was now; and he was through$
+the gate, gingerly treading the path, before he realised what he had$
+done. He heard voices and moved with caution. Then, after about five$
+minutes, he heard the garden gate behind him bang. The third workman had$
+arrived and the exit was closed. He made his way through the pines which$
+served to screen the house from observation. There was nobody in sight,$
+and the voices had died away. He could walk more boldly now and came at$
+last to the edge of the wood in full view of the villa. Between him and$
+the house was about fifty yards of clear space. He took a chance and$
+crossed it, his objective being a ground-floor window which was open.$
+$
+The entrance was not so easily effected as he had expected. The sill of$
+the window was just above the level of his head, and offered no grip to$
+his hands. He made a tour of reconnaissance, but failed to find any$
+other entrance. Behind the sill, he thought, must be a window frame, and$
+stepping back two paces he made a leap and gripped the frame. Quickly he$
+pulled himself up and dropped into the room.$
+$
+He was conscious of a sweet, fragrant perfume the moment his head became$
+level with the window, and now he saw the explanation. The bare floor$
+was covered three inches thick with rose petals. Evidently the owner$
+made her own perfumery, and this hobby explained the open window. There$
+was no furniture in the room, which was apparently given up to the$
+purpose of drying the petals. The door was unfastened, and he passed$
+into a stone corridor. The structure of the house puzzled him. He did$
+not expect to find himself in the basement; then he remembered that the$
+villa was built on sloping ground, and that the main entrance must be on$
+a higher floor.$
+$
+A flight of stone steps led to the upper level, and he went up$
+cautiously, a step at a time, and found his exit barred by a door which$
+was fastened on the other side with padlock and staple. It was a$
+primitive method of locking up a cellar, and Timothy, remembering that$
+he had passed a recess filled with garden tools, went back to find the$
+means to remove this obstruction. A long chisel prised the staples from$
+the door with ridiculous ease.$
+$
+He heard voices speaking in low, guarded tones and moved along the$
+carpeted hall on tiptoe. He listened at the door of the room from which$
+the voices proceeded, and was in two minds as to what his next step$
+should be. The door was one of two let in the same wall. He stopped and$
+brought his ear to the keyhole of the second and there was no sound.$
+Turning the handle, he looked in.$
+$
+As he expected, it was separated from the other room by a pair of$
+folding doors which were closed. The voices were more distinct but still$
+indistinguishable. He was now in a small drawing-room, well but not$
+luxuriously furnished. Tall French windows led to a loggia, and, what$
+was more important, on either side of these hung long velvet curtains,$
+which might serve, in case of necessity, as a place of concealment.$
+$
+He heard the door of the next room open, and the voices proceeded along$
+the passage. Then the handle of his own door turned. He had just time to$
+slip behind the curtains before somebody entered. It was a woman, and at$
+the sound of her voice he nearly jumped. She was speaking to somebody in$
+the passage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He has gone to his room,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Have your breakfast. He will want$
+you to go into Monte Carlo this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\By daylight?‚M-^@M-^] said the person to whom she spoke, and again Timothy$
+recognised the voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He would not know you with those spectacles. Besides, you had a$
+moustache when you saw him before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man in the passage mumbled something, and Timothy heard the door of$
+the room close. There was a desk, he had noticed, against the blank wall$
+of the room, and it was to this she made her way. He heard the$
+scratching of her pen on paper, then he walked from his place of$
+concealment. Her back was to him and she did not hear him until his$
+shadow fell across the table. Then, with a little cry, she leapt up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good morning, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XXI$
+$
+$
+SADIE MAXELL was as white as the paper on which she had been writing.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you get in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy did not answer. He stepped round so that he was between the$
+woman and the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where is Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to know of him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lower your voice, if you please,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What is$
+Cartwright to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She licked her dry lips before she spoke. Then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I married Cartwright or Benson in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tyears ago,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+Timothy took a step back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You married Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said incredulously. ‚M-^@M-^\That explains why you$
+came away?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was looking at him steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it wanted any explanation‚M-^@M-^Tyes,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to$
+do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going after the man you have upstairs, the fake Moor, who came into$
+this house half an hour ago, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to hand him to justice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before he knew what had happened, she gripped him by his coat with both$
+hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are not going to do anything of the kind, Mr. ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said between her teeth, and her voice trembled with$
+passion. ‚M-^@M-^\I hated him once, but that was before I knew him. I would$
+sooner see you dead as the other man died than that you should bring him$
+more trouble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let me go,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, trying to press loose her hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll leave this house and forget that you were ever here. Oh, you$
+fool, you fool!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had wrenched himself clear of her and flung her backward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have a few words to say to your friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I think you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better stay here whilst I‚M-^@M-^Ym saying them. I hate having family quarrels$
+in public, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had not heard the door open behind him and it was the ‚M-^@M-^\swish‚M-^@M-^] of the$
+loaded cane which warned him. It did not strike him fair on the head, as$
+was intended, but caught him a glancing blow and he fell on his knees,$
+turning his face to his attacker. He knew it was Brown even before the$
+blow fell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I settle him?‚M-^@M-^] said a voice as the stick went up again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no!‚M-^@M-^] cried the woman, ‚M-^@M-^\for God‚M-^@M-^Ys sake, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was at that moment that Timothy low-tackled his assailant. Brown$
+tried to strike, but he was too late and went crashing to the floor, his$
+head against the wall. He made one effort to rise, and then with a groan$
+collapsed.$
+$
+Timothy rose, shaking himself and rubbing his bruised shoulder. Without$
+a word, and with only a look at the woman, he made for the door and$
+banged it in her face. His head was swimming as he made his way up the$
+stairs, swaying at every step. From the broad landing at the top led$
+three doors, only one of which was closed. He turned the handle and went$
+in.$
+$
+A man was standing by the window, which overlooked the calm expanse of$
+ocean, glittering in the light of the rising sun. From shoulder to heel$
+he was clad in a long white mantle and a dark blue turban encircled his$
+head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\you and I will settle accounts.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man had not moved at the sound of the voice, but when Timothy had$
+finished he turned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My God!‚M-^@M-^] cried Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                            CHAPTER THE LAST$
+$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\TIMOTHY,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary, ‚M-^@M-^\I was just thinking about that beautiful house$
+you took me to see at Cap Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Were you, dear?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy without any show of interest.$
+$
+They were on the cross-Channel boat and Boulogne was astern.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you know, I had a feeling that you had taken$
+me there to show me to somebody, some friend of yours perhaps. All the$
+time I was walking about the garden I had a sense of being watched. It$
+is not an uncomfortable sensation, but just that overlooked feeling one$
+has sometimes. I love Monte Carlo. Do you think we shall go back there$
+after‚M-^@M-^Tafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is likely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl rose and went forward along the deck to get a view of a passing$
+destroyer. Timothy took a letter from his pocket and read it for about$
+the twentieth time. It was undated and began:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MY DEAR ANDERSON,‚M-^@M-^TI cannot tell you how grateful I am to you$
+    for your kindness and for the big, generous sympathy you have$
+    shown me. Especially am I glad that you brought Mary so that I$
+    could see her again, for I just hungered for a sight of the$
+    child. Won‚M-^@M-^Yt you please forgive Sadie? She acted without my$
+    knowledge but in my interests, as she thought, in trying to keep$
+    you away from Monte Carlo after she had planned to bring the$
+    girl so that I could see her.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I killed Cartwright, but I shot him in self-defence. His$
+    body lies at the bottom of a disused well in the garden of my$
+    house. It is perfectly true that I had been associated in$
+    business with him and that I was in his Moorish syndicate and$
+    heavily involved. I was so very deeply involved at one time, and$
+    so near to ruin that, deceived by some statement which had been$
+    made to Sadie‚M-^@M-^Ys fortune, I made her acquaintance and married$
+    her. During the past year I have never ceased to thank God that$
+    I did so, for she had been the most loyal companion and friend$
+    that a man could desire.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\It was I who fired the shot through my own window. I$
+    contemplated flight from Cartwright, and was manufacturing$
+    evidence against him in advance‚M-^@M-^TGod forgive me. Sadie guessed,$
+    and when she watched me drawing from the well the bag containing$
+    proof that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys charge was not wholly false, she knew$
+    the end was near.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I am perfectly happy, and spend most of my time developing my$
+    property in Morocco, under the protection of El Mograb, an old$
+    Moorish friend of mine, and the supreme protection of the$
+    Sultan, who, as the Pretender, received considerable help from$
+    me. I am six months of the year with Sadie, for Sadie either$
+    lives on the Riviera or at Cadiz and is easily reachable in my$
+    hired yacht.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I think it best for all concerned, and especially for our dear$
+    Mary, that I remain as dead. Some day the whole story may be$
+    told, but no useful purpose would be served by publishing it$
+    to-day. The card with the message was intended for her, but I am$
+    glad that it fell into your hands. As you guessed, it was I who$
+    flung Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys money into your room‚M-^@M-^TI dared not post it to her$
+    for fear I was betrayed by my writing, and I knew that you were$
+    safe. God bless you both and bring you happiness and prosperity,$
+    to which I hope this property of mine will one day contribute.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy folded the letter and was putting it in his pocket, then changed$
+his mind and took it out. He read it again, then tore it into pieces and$
+flung it over the side of the ship.$
+$
+Then he too went forward to the wife he had married in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tmuch$
+against the wishes of a scandalised Mrs. Renfrew‚M-^@M-^Twho nevertheless$
+termed it ‚M-^@M-^\a pretty romance‚M-^@M-^] in the article she wrote for the _Bath$
+County Herald_.$

+$
+$
+    A Wonder for$
+    Wise Men$
+    By$
+    Wallace B. Nichols$
+$
+    THOUGH an historical romance, this book is much more than$
+    that, for its theme touches present-day ideas in a remarkable$
+    manner, especially as concerns the hideous uselessness of war.$
+    It is set in the reign of Henry VII and deals with the aftermath$
+    of the Wars of the Roses. The principal character becomes one of$
+    the King‚M-^@M-^Ys most trusted instruments in the founding of modern$
+    England, and the story marches to an emotional and uplifting$
+    close. This is an historical novel where the characters are not$
+    puppets of impossible romance, but living human beings as real$
+    as the people about us every day.$

+$
+    SECRET MARKET$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This is a first novel by one of our younger poets, and it is a$
+    novel which equally plainly shows him to be an artist. The plot$
+    is cleverly developed, and the story ends at once dramatically$
+    and artistically.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The Glasgow Herald._$
+$
+    BRITTLE GLORY$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Wallace B. Nichols deserves congratulation. He has demonstrated$
+    a capacity for expression, in terms of strength, beauty and$
+    sincerity, through two mediums. It is an uncommon book with an$
+    outstanding quality: it never ceases to be readable.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The$
+    Observer._$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Nichols has all the gifts of a great novelist: an unerring sense$

+    Explains$
+    By$
+    H. C. Bailey$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MR. FORTUNE‚M-^@M-^] has long since established himself as one of the$
+    brightest stars in the galaxy of modern crime detectives. He$
+    works on the friendliest terms with Scotland Yard, but his$
+    methods‚M-^@M-^Tand incidentally his manners‚M-^@M-^Tare peculiarly his own.$
+    Here we have a series of the most widely divergent mysteries$
+    successively solved by a bland, imperturbable middle-aged$
+    gentleman whose sole concern in life appears to be that he shall$
+    not miss his lunch or any other comfort that is due to him. No$
+    one who has read other ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Fortune‚M-^@M-^] volumes will on any account$
+    miss this, while those who have yet to make the dear man‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+    acquaintance are to be envied for the joy that awaits them.$

+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   Mr. H. C. Bailey is not only a master in the realm of historic$
+    romance, but in that of the mystery story as well: in fact, he is$
+    easily one of the best and most logical of all the many writers of$
+    the detective story to-day.$

+    The Subway$
+    Mystery$
+    By$
+    Ben Bolt$
+$
+    ONE would think it impossible for anybody to walk down into$
+    the crowded new Piccadilly Circus Tube Station and there be$
+    swiftly murdered without immediate discovery of the assassin.$
+    But from the slenderest of clues the whole failure of a great$
+    vengeance is discovered, and Mr. Ben Bolt has provided in his$
+    new story a series of situations and adventures that would keep$
+    the sleepiest reader agog for the end.$

+    ambitious theme. Subtle characterization is here combined with$
+    the thrills of an Armada treasure hunt, complicated by the$
+    misunderstandings and perplexities of three widely divergent$
+    love affairs. The scenes are laid partly in Spain, partly in the$
+    Western Isles, and what with bloodstained daggers, mysterious$
+    scraps of parchment, buried caskets, plotting priests,$
+    mysterious garden-haunting strangers, and speedy motor-boats,$
+    the reader is kept constantly guessing.$

+1.F.$
+$
+1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable$
+effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread$
+works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project$
+Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm$
+electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may$
+contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate$
+or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other$
+intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or$
+other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or$
+cannot be read by your equipment.$
+$
+1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right$
+of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project$
+Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project$
+Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project$
+Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all$
+liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal$
+fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT$
+LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE$
+PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE$
+TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE$
+LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR$
+INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH$
+DAMAGE.$
+$
+1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a$
+defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can$
+receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a$
+written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you$
+received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium$
+with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you$
+with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in$
+lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person$
+or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second$
+opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If$
+the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing$
+without further opportunities to fix the problem.$
+$
+1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth$
+in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO$
+OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT$

+$
+1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied$
+warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of$
+damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement$

+accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the$
+production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm$
+electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,$
+including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of$
+the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this$
+or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or$
+additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any$
+Defect you cause.$
+$
+Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of$
+electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of$
+computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It$
+exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations$
+from people in all walks of life.$
+$
+Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the$
+assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's$
+goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will$
+remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project$
+Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure$
+and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future$
+generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see$
+Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at$
+www.gutenberg.org$
+$
+$
+$
+Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation$
+$
+The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit$
+501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the$
+state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal$
+Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification$
+number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by$
+U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.$
+$
+The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the$

+    Chief Executive and Director$
+    gbnewby@pglaf.org$
+$
+Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg$
+Literary Archive Foundation$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide$
+spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of$
+increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be$
+freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest$
+array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations$
+($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt$
+status with the IRS.$
+$
+The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating$
+charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United$
+States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a$
+considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up$
+with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations$
+where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND$
+DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular$
+state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we$
+have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition$
+against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who$
+approach us with offers to donate.$
+$
+International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make$
+any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from$
+outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.$
+$
+Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation$
+methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other$
+ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To$
+donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.$
+$
+Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project$
+Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be$
+freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and$
+distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of$
+volunteer support.$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed$
+editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in$
+the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not$
+necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper$
+edition.$
+$
+Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search$
+facility: www.gutenberg.org$
+$
+This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,$
+including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to$
+subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.$

+                               CHAPTER I$
+$
+$
+IT was two hours after the muezzin had called to evening prayer, and$
+night had canopied Tangier with a million stars. In the little Sok, the$
+bread-sellers sat cross-legged behind their wares, their candles burning$
+steadily, for there was not so much as the whisper of a wind blowing.$
+The monotonous strumming of a guitar from a Moorish caf√©, the agonised$
+_barlak!_ of a belated donkey-driver bringing his charge down the steep$
+streets which lead to the big bazaar, the shuffle of bare feet on$
+Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys cobbles, and the distant hush-hush of the rollers breaking$
+upon the amber shore‚M-^@M-^Tthese were the only sounds which the night held.$
+$
+John Maxell sat outside the Continental Caf√©, in the condition of bodily$
+content which a good dinner induces. Mental content should have$
+accompanied such a condition, but even the memory of a perfect dinner$
+could not wholly obliterate a certain uneasiness of mind. He had been$
+uneasy when he came to Tangier, and his journey through France and Spain$
+had been accompanied by certain apprehensions and doubts which$
+Cartwright had by no means dispelled.$
+$
+Rather, by his jovial evasions, his cheery optimism, and at times his$
+little irritable outbreaks of temper, he had given the eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Counsel further cause for disquiet.$
+$
+Cartwright sat at the other side of the table, and was unusually quiet.$
+This was a circumstance which was by no means displeasing to Maxell, for$
+the night was not conducive to talk. There are in Northern Africa many$
+nights like this, when one wishes to sit in dead silence and let thought$
+take its own course, unchecked and untrammelled. In Morocco such nights$
+are common and, anyway, Maxell had always found it difficult to discuss$
+business matters after dinner.$
+$
+Cartwright had no temperament and his quiet was due to other causes. It$
+was he who broke the silence, knocking out his pipe on the iron-topped$
+table with a clang which jarred his more sensitive companion to the very$
+spine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd stake my life and my soul on there being a reef,‚M-^@M-^] he said with a$
+suddenness which was almost as jarring. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, you‚M-^@M-^Yve seen the outcrop$
+for yourself, and isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it exactly the same formation as you see on the$
+Rand?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell nodded.$
+$
+Though a common-law man, he had been associated in mining cases and had$
+made a very careful study of the whole problem of gold extraction.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It looks right enough to me,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but as against that we have the$
+fact that some clever engineers have spent a great deal of time and$
+money trying to locate the reef. That there is gold in Morocco everybody$
+knows, and I should say, Cartwright, that you are right. But where is$
+the reef? It would cost a fortune to bore, even though we had the other$
+borings to guide us.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other made an impatient noise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if the reef were all mapped out it would be a simple matter,$
+but then we shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt get on to it, as we are to-day, at the cost of a$
+few thousands. Hang it all, Maxell, we‚M-^@M-^Yve got to take a certain amount$
+of risk! I know it‚M-^@M-^Ys a gamble quite as well as you. There‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+arguing that point with me. But other things are gambles too. Law was a$
+gamble to you for many years, and a bigger gamble after you took silk.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was a sore point with Maxell, as the other knew. A prosperous$
+junior, he had been called within the Bar, and taken upon himself the$
+function and style of King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsellor in the hope that his prosperity$
+would still further be expanded. And, like so many other men, he had$
+discovered that the successful junior is not necessarily the successful$
+K.C.$
+$
+Fortunately for him, he had long before contested and won a seat in$
+Parliament, and his service to the Government of the day had to some$
+extent ensured his future. But, financially, he had suffered$
+considerably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\silk isn‚M-^@M-^Yt any great catch to a man, I agree; and it was$
+certainly a gamble, and a losing gamble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Which reminds me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there was a talk, before I left$
+London, that you would be given Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is extremely unlikely,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Anyway, if they make me$
+Solicitor-General, that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt carry Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It carries a lot of money,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright after a pause for a moment,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and it‚M-^@M-^Ys money that counts just now, Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the lawyer nodded.$
+$
+He might have added that, but for the need for money, he would long$
+since have dropped his association with Alfred Cartwright, though$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood very high in certain circles of the City of$
+London. They had been at school together, though in that period there$
+had been no very great friendship between them. And Cartwright was$
+marked out for success from the beginning. He inherited a considerable$
+business when his father died, and he enlarged and improved upon it. He$
+had taken up a hundred and one outside interests, and had made most of$
+them pay. A few of them did not pay, and it was whispered that the$
+losses upon his failures took a considerable slice of the balance that$
+accrued from his successes.$
+$
+They had met again when Maxell was a junior and Cartwright the defendant$
+in a case which, had he lost, would have made him some thirty thousand$
+pounds the poorer. When Maxell thought back upon that event, he had to$
+confess that it was not a pleasant case, being one in which Cartwright$
+had been charged with something which was tantamount to$
+misrepresentation; and, although he had won, and won brilliantly, he had$
+never felt any great pride in his achievement.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said (the pauses were frequent and long), ‚M-^@M-^\I should hardly$
+imagine that the Prime Minister loves me to that extent. In Parliament$
+you have to be an uncomfortable quantity to be really successful. You$
+must be strong enough to have a national following, and sufficiently$
+independent to keep the Whips guessing. I am known as a safe man, and I$
+hold a safe seat, which I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose if I tried. That doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt make$
+for promotion. Of course, I could have had an Under-Secretaryship for$
+the asking, and that means a couple of thousand a year, but it also$
+means that you last out the life of the administration in a subordinate$
+capacity, and that, by the time you have made good, your party is in the$
+cold shade of opposition, and there are no jobs going.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head, and returned immediately to the question of the$
+missing reef, as though he wished to take the subject from his own$
+personal affairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You say that it would cost us a lot of money if the reef was proved,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it costing us a lot now?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is. As a matter of fact,‚M-^@M-^] he confessed, ‚M-^@M-^\the actual reef is$
+costing nothing, or next to nothing, because El Mograb is helping me. In$
+our own business‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, in the Syndicate‚M-^@M-^Tour expenses are$
+more or less small; but I am doing a little independent buying, and that$
+has meant the spending of money. I am taking up all the ground to the$
+south of the Angera‚M-^@M-^Ta pretty expensive business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is rather worrying me, you know, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\your$
+scheme is ever so much too ambitious. I was figuring it out this$
+afternoon as I was sitting in my room, and I came to the conclusion$
+that, if the scheme as you outlined it to me yesterday went through, it$
+would mean your finding two millions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Three,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the other cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\but think what it means,$
+Maxell! Supposing it went through. Supposing we struck a reef, and the$
+reef continued, as I believe it will, through the country I am taking$
+up! Why, it may mean a hundred millions to me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other sighed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have reached the point where I think a hundred thousand is an$
+enormous sum,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\However, you know your own business best,$
+Cartwright. But I want to be satisfied in the matter in which we are$
+associated together, that my liability does not exceed my power to pay.$
+And there is another matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright guessed the ‚M-^@M-^\other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was looking over your titles this afternoon,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\and I see$
+no reference to the old Spanish working. I remember that you told me a$
+Spaniard had taken up a considerable stretch of country and had$
+exhausted his capital trying to prove the reef‚M-^@M-^TSe√±or Brigot, wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+that his name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded curtly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A drunkard‚M-^@M-^Tand a bad lot,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\His moral character doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt count so far as the details go; what does$
+matter is that if your theory is correct, the reef must run through his$
+property. What are you going to do about that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Buy him out,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+He rose abruptly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym walking up to the Sok,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Come along?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They tramped up the long, steep hill-street together, and they did not$
+speak till they had passed through the ancient gate into the unrelieved$
+gloom which lies outside the city.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand you, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tyou take an old man‚M-^@M-^Ys view of things,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said Cartwright irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre comparatively young, you‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+good-looker. Why the devil don‚M-^@M-^Yt you marry, and marry money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you ever tried to marry money?‚M-^@M-^] he asked dryly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said the other after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\but I should think it is pretty$
+simple.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try it,‚M-^@M-^] said the laconic Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\It is simple in books, but in real$
+life it is next to impossible. I go about a great deal in society of all$
+kinds, and I can tell you that I have never yet met an eligible spinster$
+with money‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, large money. I agree with you,‚M-^@M-^] he went on$
+after a while, ‚M-^@M-^\a man like myself should marry. And he should marry$
+well. I could give a woman a good position, but she‚M-^@M-^Ys got to be the$
+right kind of woman. There are some times when I‚M-^@M-^Ym just frantic about my$
+position. I am getting older‚M-^@M-^TI am forty-seven next birthday‚M-^@M-^Tand every$
+day that slips past is a day lost. I ought to be married, but I can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+afford a wife. It is a blackguardly thing to talk about money in$
+connection with marriage and yet somehow I can think of nothing$
+else‚M-^@M-^Twhenever the thought arises in my mind I see an imaginary beauty$
+sitting on a big bag of gold!‚M-^@M-^] He chuckled to himself. ‚M-^@M-^\Let‚M-^@M-^Ys go back,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the big Sok always gives me the creeps.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Something lumbered past him in the darkness, some big, overpowering$
+beast with an unpleasant smell, and a guttural voice cried in Arabic:$
+‚M-^@M-^\Beware!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Camels!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright briefly. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre bringing in the stuff for$
+the morning market. The night‚M-^@M-^Ys young yet, Maxell. Let us go up to the$
+theatre.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt even know the theatre was open.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is called theatre by courtesy,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\the$
+inhabitants refer to it as the circus. It‚M-^@M-^Ys a big wooden place on the$
+sea edge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know it, I know it,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\What is being played? The only$
+people I have ever seen there have been Spanish artistes‚M-^@M-^Tand pretty bad$
+artistes, too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, there‚M-^@M-^Ys a treat for you. It is an English company, or rather, a$
+variety company with a number of English turns,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\We$
+might do worse‚M-^@M-^Tat least, I might,‚M-^@M-^] he added ominously.$
+$
+When they reached the theatre they found it sparsely filled. Cartwright$
+took one of the open boxes, and his companion settled himself into a$
+corner to smoke. The turns were of the kind which are usually to be met$
+with on the Levant; a tawdrily attired lady sang a humorous song in$
+Spanish, the humour being frankly indecent. There were a juggler and a$
+man with performing dogs, and then ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^] was announced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, turning to the programme.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may even be Irish,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell dryly.$
+$
+The wheezy little orchestra played a few bars and the girl came on. She$
+was pretty‚M-^@M-^Tthere was no doubt about that‚M-^@M-^Tand of a prettiness which$
+satisfied both men. She was also British or American, for the song she$
+sang was in a French with which both men were familiar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is horrible to see an English girl in a place like this and in such$
+company,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder where she‚M-^@M-^Ys staying,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, half to himself, and a$
+contemptuous little smile curled Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going to rescue her from her infamous surroundings?‚M-^@M-^] he asked,$
+and Cartwright snapped round on him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wish to heaven you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic, Maxell. That‚M-^@M-^Ys twice this$
+evening‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, snicking off the ash of his cigar. ‚M-^@M-^\I am in a$
+cynical mood to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He raised his hands to applaud the girl as she bowed herself from the$
+stage, and glanced round the house. Three boxes away was a small party$
+of men, whom he judged were the sons of prosperous members of the$
+Spanish colony. Their fingers flashed with diamonds, their cigarettes$
+burnt from jewelled holders. Cartwright followed the direction of the$
+other‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys made a hit, that Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\These fellows will be$
+tumbling over one another to present her with verbal bouquets. I wonder$
+where she lives!‚M-^@M-^] he said again.$
+$
+Presently the young men rose in a body and left the box, and Cartwright$
+grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you mind hanging on here whilst I go outside?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a bit,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\Where are you off to? To find out where$
+she lives?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you go again,‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I think Tangier makes you$
+liverish.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When he had got to the promenade, the men had disappeared, but a$
+question directed to the head attendant revealed, as he had expected,$
+the objective of the little party at the stage door.$
+$
+The stage door was reached from the outside of the theatre and involved$
+a journey over rubble and brick heaps. Presently he came to an open$
+doorway, where sat a solitary half-caste smoking a pipe and reading an$
+old _Heraldo_.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, _hombre_,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in Spanish, ‚M-^@M-^\have you seen my three$
+friends come in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] nodded the man; ‚M-^@M-^\they have just entered.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He indicated the direction, which lay through a dark and smelly passage.$
+$
+Cartwright walked along this stuffy hallway, and, turning the corner,$
+came upon an interesting group gathered about a closed door, against$
+which one, and the least sober, of the party was hammering. Near by$
+stood a small, stout man in soiled evening dress, grinning his approval,$
+and it was clear that the visitors were at once known and welcome.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open the door, my dream of joy,‚M-^@M-^] hiccupped the young man, hammering at$
+the panel. ‚M-^@M-^\We have come to bring you homage and adoration‚M-^@M-^Ttell her to$
+open the door, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he addressed the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, and$
+the small man minced forward and spoke in English.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is all right, my dear. Some friends of mine wish to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A voice inside, which Cartwright recognised, answered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not see them. Tell them to go away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You hear?‚M-^@M-^] said the manager, shrugging his shoulders. ‚M-^@M-^\She will not see$
+you. Now go back to your seats and let me persuade her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or!‚M-^@M-^] He raised his eyebrows to the unexpected apparition of$
+Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you doing here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is forbidden to enter the theatre through the saloon of artistes,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the small man pompously. ‚M-^@M-^\If Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your friend, you must$
+wait for her until the performance is over.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright took no notice. He was a tall man of athletic build and$
+shouldering his way past the others with no difficulty, he tapped on the$
+panel.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\here is an English visitor wants to see you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English?‚M-^@M-^] said the voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Come in for the love of Mike!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The door was opened, and a girl with a silk kimono pulled over her stage$
+dress, offered him a smiling welcome. The young Spaniard who had been$
+hammering on the panel of the door would have followed, but Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+arm barred him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want this fellow?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do I want him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady bitterly, ‚M-^@M-^\do I want the scarlet$
+fever or measles? You bet I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want him. He‚M-^@M-^Ys been pestering me ever$
+since I‚M-^@M-^Yve been here.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you hear what the lady says?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, speaking in Spanish.$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does not desire your acquaintance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My father owns this theatre,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man loudly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then he‚M-^@M-^Ys got a rotten property,‚M-^@M-^] replied the calm Cartwright.$
+$
+The Spaniard turned in a rage to his soiled satellite.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You will put this man out at once, Jose, or there will be trouble for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little man shrugged his helplessness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said in English, ‚M-^@M-^\you see my unhappy position. The se√±or is$
+the son of my proprietor and it will be bad for me if you stay. I ask$
+you as a friend and caballero to go at once and spare me misfortune.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright looked at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Must you go on again in this infernal place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, laughter and admiration in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens if you chuck this infernal job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym fired,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve a ten weeks‚M-^@M-^Y contract with these$
+people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you get?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two hundred and fifty pesetas a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+wonderful salary, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How many more weeks have you to go before your contract is finished?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another four,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\we‚M-^@M-^Yre playing in Cadiz next week, in Seville$
+the week after, then Malaga, then Granada.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you like it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like it!‚M-^@M-^] the scorn in her voice was her answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The dresses belong to the troupe, I guess,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Get into your$
+street clothes and I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, eyeing him narrowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good your lost contract,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an English girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Irish,‚M-^@M-^] she corrected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean Irish,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an Irish girl doing$
+this kind of thing with a lot of horrible half-breeds. You‚M-^@M-^Yve talent$
+enough for London or Paris. What about Paris? I know any number of$
+people there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Could you get me a good engagement?‚M-^@M-^] she asked eagerly.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys your name, anyway?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never mind about my name. Smith, Brown, Jones, Robinson‚M-^@M-^Tanything you$
+like.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was the agitated little manager who interfered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you must not persuade this lady to leave the theatre. I$
+have her under heavy penalties. I can bring her before the judge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now just forget that!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there is no judge in Tangier.$
+She is a British subject, and the most you can do is to take her before$
+the British Consul.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When she returns to Spain‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said the little man growing apoplectic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She will not return to Spain. She will go to Gibraltar if she goes$
+anywhere,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and from Gibraltar she will be on the sea$
+until she reaches a British port.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will go to the Spanish Consul,‚M-^@M-^] screamed the little manager, clawing$
+the air. ‚M-^@M-^\I will not be robbed. You shall not interfere with my$
+business, you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Much of this, thought Cartwright, was intended for the glowering young$
+Spaniard who stood in the background. He went outside, closed the door$
+and stood with his back toward it. On a whispered instruction from his$
+employer‚M-^@M-^Ys son, whose hands were now flickering fire as he gesticulated$
+in his excitement, Jose the manager disappeared, and returned a few$
+minutes later with two stalwart stage hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Will you leave this theatre at once and quietly?‚M-^@M-^] demanded the foaming$
+manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not leave the theatre until I am ready,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+if I leave otherwise, I shall certainly not leave quietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The manager stood back with a melodramatic gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eject the caballero,‚M-^@M-^] he said finely.$
+$
+The two men hesitated. Then one came forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The se√±or must leave,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In good time, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+A hand gripped his arm, but instantly he had shaken free, and had driven$
+with all his strength at the man‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw. The stage hand dropped like a$
+log. He pushed at the door behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put your kimono over your things,‚M-^@M-^] he said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\You can send the$
+stage kit back to-morrow. There is going to be a rough house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All right,‚M-^@M-^] said a voice behind him, and the girl slipped out, still in$
+her kimono and carrying a bundle of clothes under her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know the way out? I‚M-^@M-^Yll follow you. Now, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he said flippantly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going‚M-^@M-^Tquietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER II$
+$
+$
+HE left behind him a pandemonium of sound and a scintillation of$
+flickering diamonds. He found the girl waiting for him in the darkness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Br-r-r! It‚M-^@M-^Ys cold!‚M-^@M-^] she shivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you staying?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the little hotel opposite the British Consulate,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt much of a place, but it was the only room I could get‚M-^@M-^Tat the$
+price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better not go there,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll send for your boxes in the$
+morning. Give me those clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took them from her and put them under his arm, and she fell in by his$
+side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad to be out of it,‚M-^@M-^] she said breathlessly, taking his arm;$
+‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a dog‚M-^@M-^Ys life. I was going to quit to-morrow. Those boys have been$
+following me round ever since I came to Tangier. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better go back to my hotel, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a moment; ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+pretty tough crowd, these Spaniards, and though I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand their$
+beastly language, I know just what kind of happy holiday they‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+planning for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were in the town, passing up the street of the mosque, when she$
+asked him:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you taking me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the Continental,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like this?‚M-^@M-^] she said in dismay, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have an office in this street,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\you can go in and dress.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you outside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He showed her into the tiny room which served as the headquarters of the$
+Angera Gold Mining Syndicate, and sat on the irregular stone steps,$
+waiting until she was dressed. Presently she came out, a presentable and$
+an attractive figure.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just thought,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you had better to go the$
+Central‚M-^@M-^TI am staying at the Continental and it wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt look nice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been thinking something of the sort myself,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What about$
+my broken engagement? Were you joking when you said you would pay? I$
+hate talking about money, but I am broke‚M-^@M-^TJose owes me a week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good the money to-morrow,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I can give you a tenner$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the idea?‚M-^@M-^] she asked him again. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve read a lot of books, and$
+I know the knight errant business backwards. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt strike me as$
+being a something-for-nothing man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\It occurred to me when I saw you on the$
+stage, that you might be useful. I want a person in Paris I can$
+trust‚M-^@M-^Tsomebody who could look after my interests.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a business woman,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I hate business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Business is done by men,‚M-^@M-^] said he significantly. ‚M-^@M-^\And there are a few$
+men I want you to keep track of. Do you understand that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see,‚M-^@M-^] she said at last. ‚M-^@M-^\It is better than I thought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He did not trouble to ask her what she had thought, or what she imagined$
+he had planned, but saw her into the hotel, arranged for a room, and$
+walked slowly back to the Continental. He was in the vestibule of that$
+hotel before he remembered that he had left an eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel$
+and Member of Parliament smoking his cigar in a _loge_ of the Tangier$
+circus.$
+$

+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I missed you,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell the next morning. ‚M-^@M-^\When you remembered and$
+came to pick me up, I was on my way back‚M-^@M-^Twe must have passed somewhere$
+in the little Sok. What happened last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing much,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\I went round and saw the girl.$
+She was very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How amusing?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, just amusing.‚M-^@M-^] Vaguely: ‚M-^@M-^\I found her annoyed by the attention which$
+was being paid to her by a veritable Spanish hidalgo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you sailed in and rescued her, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\And what happened$
+to her after she was rescued?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I saw her home to her hotel, and there the matter ended. By the way,$
+she leaves by the _Gibel Musa_ for Gibraltar this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] Maxell looked absently at the letter he had in his hand, folded it$
+and put it away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is the mail in?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright, interested, and Maxell nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve had your daily letter from your kiddie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is not a baby letter, but it is very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How old is she?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She must be nine or ten,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is just coincidence, or whether it is fate,‚M-^@M-^] mused$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is a coincidence?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve got a kid to look after, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym in a sort of way$
+responsible for a bright lad. Mine is less interesting than yours, I$
+think. Anyway, he‚M-^@M-^Ys a boy and a sort of cousin. He has two fool parents$
+who were born to slavery‚M-^@M-^Tthe sort of people who are content to work for$
+somebody all their lives and regard revolt against their condition as an$
+act of impiety. I‚M-^@M-^Yve only seen the kid once, and he struck me as the$
+sort who might break loose from that kind of life and take a chance.$
+Otherwise, I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have interested myself in him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How far does your interest extend?‚M-^@M-^] asked Maxell curiously. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not$
+the sort of person, I should imagine, who would take up the unfortunate$
+poor as a hobby.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a something-for-nothing man, in fact,‚M-^@M-^] laughed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been told that twice in twenty-four hours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who was the other person‚M-^@M-^Tthe actress?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright roared with laughter and slapped the other on the knee.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No, I am not a something-for-nothing$
+person. I‚M-^@M-^Ym one of those optimists who plant fir cones so that I shall$
+have some good firewood for my old age. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what sort of a man$
+Timothy will make, but, as I say, he shapes good, and anyway, you and I$
+are in the same boat.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except this,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\that from what you say, you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+particularly interested in your prot√©g√©, and you don‚M-^@M-^Yt really care$
+whether he shapes good or shapes bad.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys true,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an experiment.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little girl is something more than that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell quietly;$
+‚M-^@M-^\she‚M-^@M-^Ys the only living thing I have any real affection for‚M-^@M-^Tshe is my$
+dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your niece, eh? Well, that gives you an interest which I have not. I$
+never had a niece and I should just hate to be called uncle, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Their conversation was interrupted at this point by the arrival of a$
+small man dressed in his best clothes. On his brow was a frown which was$
+intended to be terrible, but was slightly amusing. Jose Ferreira had$
+dressed and prepared himself for an interview which, as he had described$
+to his friends, could not fail to be at once ‚M-^@M-^\terrifying and vital.‚M-^@M-^]$
+For, as he had said: ‚M-^@M-^\This man has sliced my life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He began his speech to Cartwright as he had rehearsed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Estoy indignado‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T_‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright cut him short with an expression of mock fear.$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Horroroso!_ You are indignant, are you? Well, come, little man, and$
+tell me why you are indignant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] said the man solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\you have put upon me a humiliation and$
+a shame which all my life I shall regret.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The conversation was in Spanish, but Maxell was an excellent Spanish$
+scholar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, before Jose, still labouring under the$
+sense of his wrongs, could get going again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen to him and discover,‚M-^@M-^] mocked Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have taken from his$
+incomparable company its joy and its gem.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In other words, the amiable Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, yes, se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] broke in Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\For me it is ruin! The money I have$
+spent to make my company perfect! It is financed by one who is the$
+greatest man in Tangier and it is his son who tells me that, unless I$
+bring back this lady‚M-^@M-^Tfor me there is the street and the gutter,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+wept.$
+$
+Maxell looked slyly at his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys another chance for you to plant a fir cone,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+you find some use for this gentleman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright was not smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] he said crisply, ‚M-^@M-^\you are, as all Spain knows, a thief$
+and a rogue. If you associate with bigger thieves and bigger scoundrels,$
+that is your business. I can only tell you that you may think yourself$
+lucky I did not bring this case before the Spanish Consul. I assure you,$
+you would never have put your foot in Tangier again after the stories I$
+have heard about you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little Spaniard was open-mouthed and impressed. He was also a little$
+frightened. Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation had been at a venture, but he argued$
+that it was scarcely likely that, in an establishment of the description$
+which Mr. Ferreira controlled, there could have been no incidents which$
+reflected upon the manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything which is said about me is a lie!‚M-^@M-^] said the little man$
+vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I have lived a life of the highest virtue! To-day I$
+complain to the British Consul, and we shall see!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Complain,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This chance I will give you.‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Ferreira wagged a fat, stumpy$
+finger. ‚M-^@M-^\Restore to me Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and the matter shall go no$
+farther.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady has left Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] said the other calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\so it is clear$
+to you that I cannot restore her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She has not left,‚M-^@M-^] vociferated the Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\We had a man to watch the$
+boat leaving for the _Gibel Musa_ and she did not leave the pier.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She left the beach,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright patiently; ‚M-^@M-^\she was rowed out$
+by a boatman from the Cecil. At this moment she is half-way to$
+Gibraltar.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira groaned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is ruin for me,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps for you also,‚M-^@M-^] he added$
+ominously. ‚M-^@M-^\I can do no less than depart for Paris to lay this matter$
+before my excellent patron, Se√±or Don‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright jerked his head to the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Get out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and turned his attention to the newspaper which he$
+had picked up from the table.$
+$
+Maxell waited until the little man had gone, still seething with his$
+‚M-^@M-^\indignado,‚M-^@M-^] then turned to Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is rather a serious matter, Cartwright; what has happened to the$
+girl?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you hear? I have sent her to Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt leave a dog in that company. And from Gibraltar she goes home$
+by the first P. & O.,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you ‚M-^@M-^Xhming‚M-^@M-^Y about?‚M-^@M-^] snarled his companion. ‚M-^@M-^\The girl$
+is gone. I shall not see her again. It was an act of charity. Do you$
+disapprove?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you felt so bad about it. No, I$
+think you‚M-^@M-^Yve done the girl a very good turn. But in these days one$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt expect‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blessed is he that expecteth nothing, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright$
+sententiously, ‚M-^@M-^\for he shall not be disappointed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose that$
+the proprietor, whoever he is, cares a snap of his fingers about the$
+matter‚M-^@M-^Tit is his infernal son who will fire the adorable Jose.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+That afternoon the two men had an interview on the outskirts of the town$
+with a very plainly dressed Moor, who came to them so cautiously that$
+the observers might have been pardoned if they thought he was a$
+criminal. In the eyes of the divine rulers of Morocco he was something$
+more than a criminal, because he was an emissary of El Mograb, the$
+Pretender. There was a price upon the messenger‚M-^@M-^Ys head, and his caution$
+was, therefore, commendable. He brought a letter from El Mograb to$
+Cartwright, and it was a message of cheer.$
+$
+Maxell and his friend had gone out early in the afternoon and had waited$
+two hours under a scorching sun for the courier to arrive. For a man of$
+law, the fact that he was coquetting with the Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy did not$
+distress Maxell, who knew the history of the country too well to worry$
+very much about Sultan or Pretender. The Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys reign, marked with the$
+turbulence of people and the self-indulgence of monarch, was already$
+doomed. His uncle, El Mograb, a born leader of men and captain of seven$
+thousand well-armed soldiers, was but waiting the psychological moment$
+to strike; and Adbul, with his motor-cars and brass bedstead, his$
+geegaws and his frippery, would disappear into the limbo which is$
+especially reserved for extravagant and unstable rulers.$
+$
+The news from El Mograb was good. It reconfirmed the concession which$
+one of his shereefs had made on his behalf, and sent a message in$
+flowery Arabic‚M-^@M-^Ta message of thanks to the man who had supplied him with$
+the very necessary rifles.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That was news to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright as they rode back to the town. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you were gun-running, Maxell, or that you were so solid with$
+El Mograb.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I like El Mograb,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the many Moors who have$
+impressed me. You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that I have been visiting Morocco since$
+I was a boy and most of the chiefs are known to me personally. I knew El$
+Mograb‚M-^@M-^Ys brother, who was killed at Tetuan, and when he was a favourite$
+in court circles he entertained me at Fez.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his word worth?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is worth all the contracts that ever went to Somerset House for$
+stamping,‚M-^@M-^] said the other with emphasis. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you can go ahead with$
+your scheme.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go back to London and raise the money,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We shall want a$
+couple of millions eventually, but half a million will do to go on with.$
+You had better be with me in the big scheme, Maxell. There is nothing to$
+lose for you. You‚M-^@M-^Yll be in on the ground floor. What is the good of your$
+pottering about with your little Company‚M-^@M-^TI mean the Parent Company?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have faith in that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I know just the amount of my$
+indebtedness.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\The big scheme may mean$
+millions to you, and I shall want your help and guidance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell hesitated. The lure was dazzling, the prize was immense. But it$
+meant risks which he was not prepared to take. He knew something of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys financial methods; he had seen them in their working, and$
+had done not a little on one occasion to save Cartwright from the$
+consequences of his own cleverness. Yet, as he argued, Cartwright would$
+have no difficulty in raising the money from the general public, and his$
+presence on the board would certainly be a guarantee against his$
+companion departing from the narrow path.$
+$
+Although it was not generally known that he was associated in any of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises, there had been a whisper of an inquiry in$
+influential quarters, and it had been hinted to him that, on the whole,$
+it would be better if he kept himself aloof from the gentleman who,$
+admirable business man as he was, had a passion for enterprises which$
+occasionally verged upon the illegal. But those influential quarters had$
+not whispered anything in the shape of a definite promise that his$
+welfare was entirely in their keeping and that his future would not be$
+overlooked.$
+$
+He was an ambitious man, but his ambitions ran in realisable directions.$
+The services he had rendered to the Government were such as deserved a$
+recognition, and the only question was what form that recognition would$
+take? His knowledge of languages qualified him for an important$
+appointment under the Foreign Office; but the Foreign Office was a close$
+preserve and difficult to break into. There were too many permanent$
+officials who regarded the service as a family affair, and were jealous$
+of patronage outside their own charmed circle.$
+$
+He went in to lunch that day to find Cartwright reading a telegram which$
+he folded up and put into his pocket upon the other‚M-^@M-^Ys appearance.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little friend has arrived in Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+Maxell looked at him curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens now?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym sending her home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys voice was brisk and he spoke in the manner of a man$
+referring to a topic too unimportant to be discussed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^] pursued Maxell, and the other shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have given her a letter of introduction to a friend of mine,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+carelessly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have one or two theatrical interests in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell said nothing, and could have dismissed the matter as lightly as$
+his companion, for the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys future scarcely interested him.$
+$
+She had been but a figure on the stage; her personality, her very$
+appearance, left no definite impression. But if he was not interested in$
+the girl, he was interested in Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private mind. Here was a man$
+of whom he could not know too much. And somehow he felt that he had$
+hardly cracked the surface of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys character though he had known$
+him for years, and though they were working together to a common end.$
+$
+The way of a man with a maid is wonderful, but it is also instructive to$
+the cold-blooded onlooker, who discovers in that way a kind of creature$
+he has never met before; a new man, so entirely different from the$
+familiar being he had met in club or drawing-room as to be almost$
+unrecognisable. And he wanted to know just this side of Cartwright,$
+because it was the side on which he had scarcely any information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you won‚M-^@M-^Yt see her again?‚M-^@M-^] he said, playing with his knife and$
+looking abstractedly out of the window.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt think so,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, and then, with a sudden$
+irritation: ‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you driving at, Maxell? I may see the$
+girl‚M-^@M-^TI go to music-halls, and it is hardly likely I should miss her.$
+Naturally I am interested in the lady I have rescued from this kind of$
+thing‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The waved his hand vaguely toward Tangier Bay‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and she may be$
+useful. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to say _you‚M-^@M-^Yre_ struck on her?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He tried to carry war into the enemy‚M-^@M-^Ys camp and failed, for Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+blue eyes met his steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know what she looks like,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am not likely to$
+fall in love with a lady who left absolutely no impression upon me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+He left next day on the boat for Cadiz, _en route_ to Paris and London,$
+and he and Cartwright had as a fellow-passenger a shabby little man$
+whose belongings were packed in an American-cloth suit-case inscribed in$
+flourishing capitals, evidently by the owner, ‚M-^@M-^\Jose Ferreira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira spent most of his time on the ship‚M-^@M-^Ys deck, biting his nails$
+and enlarging his grievance against the unconscious Cartwright.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER III$
+$
+$
+MAXELL did not stay many hours in Paris. The Sud Express landed him in$
+the French capital at seven in the morning. He left Paris by the midday$
+train for London. The Long Vacation was drawing to an end, and there$
+were briefs of certain importance requiring examination. There was also$
+a consultation with the Attorney-General on an interpretation of a$
+clause in the new Shipping Act, and he was also due to address his$
+constituents before the reassembling of Parliament.$
+$
+He might ruminate in vain to find one attractive feature of his$
+programme. Parliament wearied him, and the ordinary practices of the law$
+no longer gave him pleasure.$
+$
+There was an interest in the work he was doing for the Government, and$
+if he had the faintest hint of pleasure in his immediate prospects, the$
+cause was to be found in the vexed problems centring about this new, and$
+loosely drawn, shipping law. It was a measure which had been passed in a$
+hurry, and when the acid test of litigation had been applied, some of$
+its weak points had been discovered.$
+$
+The weakest of these points was one affecting the load-line. In an$
+action heard before a High Court Judge, the doubtful clause had been$
+interpreted so as to render the Act a dead letter; and there were$
+particular and especial Governmental reasons why the appeal which the$
+Government had made from the verdict of the lower Court should upset$
+that decision.$
+$
+There is no need to give the particulars of the great dispute, which$
+arose over the three words ‚M-^@M-^\or otherwise loaded,‚M-^@M-^] and it is only$
+necessary to say that, before he had reached London, Mr. Maxell had$
+discovered a way for the Government out of their difficulty.$
+$
+It was this opinion which he delivered to a relieved Attorney-General,$
+and, with the new argument, the Government were able to present so$
+strong a case to the Court of Appeal, that a month after his return the$
+verdict of the lower Court was reversed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney-General, ‚M-^@M-^\the devils can take it to the House$
+of Lords now and still lose‚M-^@M-^Tthanks to your brain wave, Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were smoking in the Crown Room at the Law Courts after the decision$
+had been delivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where have you been for your holiday, by the way?‚M-^@M-^] asked the Attorney$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco?‚M-^@M-^] The Attorney nodded thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you hear anything of$
+friend Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We were staying at the same hotel,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A weird person,‚M-^@M-^] said the thoughtful Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\A very curious$
+man‚M-^@M-^Twhat a Chancellor that fellow would make!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He never struck me that way,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know him well‚M-^@M-^TI mean, are you a particular friend of his?‚M-^@M-^]$
+demanded the Attorney.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\I know him‚M-^@M-^Tso many men in the law$
+know him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not by any chance associating with him in business now, are$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell promptly.$
+$
+It was a lie and he knew it was a lie. It was told deliberately from the$
+desire to stand well in the eyes of his friends. He knew Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reputation well enough, and just how he was regarded by the party whom$
+he had served for three years. Cartwright had been Member for a London$
+borough, but had resigned. ‚M-^@M-^\Pressure of business‚M-^@M-^] was the excuse he$
+gave, but there were people who said that it was owing to the pressure$
+of the Party Whips, who smelt a somewhat unsavoury case coming into$
+Court with Cartwright figuring prominently.$
+$
+There is no way of proving or disproving the statement, because the case$
+in which Cartwright most decidedly was interested was withdrawn from the$
+list at the last moment. The uncharitable say that it cost Cartwright a$
+small fortune to bring about this withdrawal, and certainly one of the$
+ladies interested (she was a small-part actress at the Hippoceus) gave$
+up her stage work and had been living in affluence ever since.$
+Cartwright pooh-poohed the suggestion that the case held anything$
+sensational‚M-^@M-^Tbut he did not enter political life again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with him,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney simply.$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an awfully nice fellow and I suppose he is as straight and as$
+sound as the best man in the City. But he‚M-^@M-^Ys a shifty fellow‚M-^@M-^Tjust a$
+little bit‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\a little wrong. You understand, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tor$
+shall we say slightly shop-soiled?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is certainly a brilliant man,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, not desirous of$
+defending his friend too vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I suppose he is,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\All men like that are$
+brilliant. What a pity his genius does not run in a smooth channel, but$
+must follow the course of a burning cracker, here, there and everywhere,$
+exploding at every turn!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped down from the table, on the edge of which he had been sitting$
+and pulled off his robe.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad to know you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with Cartwright, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said.$
+$
+Maxell did not attempt to probe beneath the surface of his$
+twice-repeated remark.$
+$
+He went back to Cavendish Square to his flat and to a tiny, solemn-eyed$
+little girl who had been brought up from Hindhead that day on her$
+monthly visit to ‚M-^@M-^\Uncle Max.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright had not accompanied his friend to England, and with good$
+reasons. A great deal of his work was carried out in Paris, where he had$
+an important financial backing. He occupied a flat overlooking the$
+imposing, but none too convenient, Avenue of the Grand Army. His home$
+was at the unfashionable end of this interminable thoroughfare, which$
+meant that his rooms were larger and his rent cheaper, and that he was$
+freer from observation than he would have been had he lived according to$
+his means or station in a luxurious flat nearer the Etoil.$
+$
+He had a board meeting to attend, an informal board meeting, it is true,$
+but none the less important.$
+$
+Cartwright was the chairman and managing director of the London and$
+Paris Gold Syndicate, a flourishing concern which held big blocks of$
+shares in various land and gold-mining companies, and controlled three$
+mines of its own on the West Rand. Though a Company drawing a modest$
+revenue from its Johannesburg property, its operations were not confined$
+to gold development pure and simple. It was, in fact, an outside$
+broker‚M-^@M-^Ys on a grand scale. It gambled heavily and gambled wisely. The$
+shareholders seldom received less than a twelve and a half per cent.$
+dividend, and there were years when in addition it paid a bonus equal to$
+its own share capital.$
+$
+It numbered its clients at one hundred and fifty thousand, the majority$
+being small people who preferred speculation to investment‚M-^@M-^Tcountry$
+parsons, doctors and the small gamblers who lived fearfully on the$
+fringe of high finance. The shares were at a premium and Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+interest brought him a considerable sum annually. What probably$
+attracted the little speculator was the knowledge of the Company‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reserve, which stood in the balance-sheet at a respectable figure. It$
+was the question of these reserves that occupied the attention of the$
+four quiet men who met informally in the room of a Paris hotel.$
+$
+There were three to one against Cartwright, because none of his$
+companions could see eye to eye with him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is too dangerous, M. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Gribber, whose nationality$
+was suspect; ‚M-^@M-^\our risks are already high and we cannot afford, in my$
+judgment, to extend them. The money would be subscribed over and over$
+again if you went to the English public.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt we make the profit?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\we could borrow from our$
+reserve.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That we can‚M-^@M-^Yt touch!‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the cautious Gribber, shaking his$
+head violently. ‚M-^@M-^\My faith, no, we cannot touch that! For it is certain$
+that the lean years will come when our clients will require their$
+dividends.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not pursue the subject. There were other ways of$
+financing his Moorish scheme.$
+$
+The Benson Syndicate, for example.$
+$
+He spoke eloquently of this new venture, which was to have its$
+headquarters in Paris, and would be under the eye of his sceptical$
+co-directors. He mentioned names glibly and easily‚M-^@M-^Tnames that carried$
+weight in the financial world. The three men agreed that the Benson$
+Syndicate had the appearance of a safe investment.$
+$

+$
+More important was the business which brought Alfred Cartwright to the$
+St. Lazaire Station to meet a passenger a week later.$
+$
+She sprang from the train and looked round with doubting face, which$
+lighted the moment she saw the saturnine Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My! I am relieved,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I was scared to think you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be$
+here to meet me, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd only got a few pounds left.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You got my wire?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, and she smiled, showing two rows of pearly$
+teeth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym still mystified,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What is it you want me to do in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us eat first and talk afterwards,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You must be hungry.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym starving!‚M-^@M-^] she laughed.$
+$
+He had a car waiting for her, and whisked her off to a little street$
+leading from the Boulevard des Italiens, where one of the best$
+restaurants in Paris is situated. The girl looked about her with an$
+approving air. The gaiety and luxury of the place appealed to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My word!‚M-^@M-^] she said enviously; ‚M-^@M-^\do you come to lunch here every day?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know this place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve seen it,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but a three-franc dinner at Duval‚M-^@M-^Ys has$
+been my limit so far.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She told him how she had come to the Continent as a dancer, and had$
+‚M-^@M-^\starred‚M-^@M-^] in a tiny little cabaret in Montmartre as one of the ‚M-^@M-^\dashing$
+Sisters Jones,‚M-^@M-^] before she had been seen by the impresario who was$
+recruiting material for his tour through the Levant.$
+$
+Cartwright judged her to be nineteen, knew her to be extremely pretty,$
+and guessed that, under certain conditions, she would be presentable$
+even to the best of the circles in which he moved. He wondered, with a$
+grim smile, what Maxell, that austere and fastidious man, would say if$
+he knew that the girl was with him in Paris. Would Maxell accept her? He$
+thought not. Maxell was a thought straitlaced and in some ways was a$
+bore. But Maxell was necessary. He was a brilliant lawyer, and moreover$
+stood well with the Government, and there might come a time when Maxell$
+would be immensely useful. He could well afford to give the lawyer a$
+slice of the pickings he intended making, because Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys wants were$
+few and his ambitions on the modest side.$
+$
+Cartwright thought in millions. Maxell was a five-figure man. If all$
+went well with Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys scheme, undoubtedly he could well afford the$
+five figures.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happened to your friend?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl, as though divining his$
+thoughts: ‚M-^@M-^\The man you told me I was to keep away from. Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+want him to see me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does it really matter?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys in England, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is he?‚M-^@M-^] She was curious.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, a friend of mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And who are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, facing him squarely. ‚M-^@M-^\If I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see$
+anything of you in Paris, that Smith, Brown or Robinson business isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+quite good enough. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me, but I want to know who I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+working for, and what is the kind of work you want me to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright pinched his neck‚M-^@M-^Ta nervous little trick of his when he was$
+thinking.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business interests here,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt want me for an office?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously. ‚M-^@M-^\My education$
+is perfectly rotten.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you for an office,‚M-^@M-^] he replied with a smile. ‚M-^@M-^\And yet$
+in a sense I want you to do office work. I have a little syndicate here,$
+which is known as the Benson Syndicate. Benson is my name‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Or the name you go by,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How sharp you are! Well, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your name, if it$
+comes to that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She made no reply and he went on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want somebody in Paris I can rely upon; somebody who will receive$
+money, transmit it to the Benson Syndicate, and re-invest that money in$
+such concerns as I shall indicate.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt use long words,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\How do you know I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to rob$
+you? Nobody‚M-^@M-^Ys ever trusted me with money before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He might have told her that she would not be trusted with a great deal$
+at a time and that she would be carefully watched. He preferred,$
+however, an explanation more flattering to his new assistant. And not$
+only was it flattering, but it contained a big grain of truth,$
+expressing, to an extent, Alfred Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys creed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Women are more honest than men,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I should think twice before$
+I put a man‚M-^@M-^Teven my best friend‚M-^@M-^Tin the position I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting you. It$
+will be a simple matter, and I shall pay you well. You can live at one$
+of the best hotels‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, it is absolutely necessary that you should.$
+You may‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\you may be Madam Benson, a rich Englishwoman.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him from under perplexed brows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the good of asking me to do that?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a tone of$
+disappointment. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were going to give me a job I could do.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Ym a fool at business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can remain a fool,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing to do except$
+carry out a certain routine, which I shall explain to you so that you$
+can‚M-^@M-^Yt possibly make a mistake. Here is a job which gives you plenty of$
+time, pays you well, gives you good clothes and an auto. Now, are you$
+going to be a sensible girl and take it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She thought a moment, then nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it means lunching here every day, I‚M-^@M-^Yll take it,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+Thus was formed the remarkable Benson Syndicate, about which so much has$
+been written, and so many theories evolved. For, if the truth be told,$
+the Benson Syndicate had no existence until Cartwright called it into$
+being in Ciro‚M-^@M-^Ys Restaurant. It was born of the opposition he had$
+received, and its creation was hastened by certain disquieting telegrams$
+which arrived almost every hour from London.$
+$
+Cartwright was, as has been said, a man of many interests. The$
+door-plate of his office in Victoria Street, London, was covered with$
+the names of the companies which had their headquarters in the ornate$
+suite which he occupied. There were two other suites of offices in the$
+City of London for which Mr. Cartwright paid the rent, although he did$
+not pay it in his own name. There were syndicates and companies$
+innumerable, Development Syndicates, Exploitation Companies, Financial$
+and Mining Companies, all duly registered and all keeping one solicitor$
+busy; for the Companies Acts are tricky, and Cartwright was too clever a$
+man to contravene minor regulations.$
+$
+And to all these companies there were shareholders; some of them$
+contented, some‚M-^@M-^Tthe majority‚M-^@M-^Twholly dissatisfied with their lot, and$
+quite a large number who were wont to show their share certificates to$
+their friends as curiosities, and tell them the sad story of how they$
+were inveigled into investment.$
+$
+Only a clever company lawyer can describe in detail the tortuous$
+character of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys system of finance. It involved loans from one$
+company to another, very often on the security of shares in a third$
+company; it involved a system of over-drafts, drawn in favour of some$
+weakly member of his family, secured by the assets of one which could$
+show a bold face to the world, and was even quoted in the Stock Exchange$
+list; and divers other complicated transactions, which only the expert$
+mathematician could follow.$
+$
+Cartwright was a rich man, accounted a millionaire by his friends; but$
+he was that type of millionaire who was never at a loss for a thousand,$
+but who was generally hard up for ten thousand. He came to London much$
+against his will, in response to an urgent telegram, and, having cleared$
+the difficulties which his subordinates had found insuperable, he had a$
+few hours to attend to his private affairs before he took the train back$
+to Paris.$
+$
+His secretary produced a heap of small bills requiring settlement, and$
+going through these, he paused before one printed slip, and frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That boy‚M-^@M-^Ys school fees weren‚M-^@M-^Yt paid last term,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said the secretary. ‚M-^@M-^\If you remember, I mentioned the matter$
+to you when you were in London last. I was taking upon myself the$
+responsibility of paying the fees, if you hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt returned. The boy is$
+coming up to-day, by the way, sir, to be measured for some clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Coming here?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Cartwright, interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright picked up the bill.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he read. ‚M-^@M-^\What does T. A. C. stand for‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XTake A$
+Chance‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understood he was named after you‚M-^@M-^TTimothy Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the secretary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes; of course,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright grinned. ‚M-^@M-^\Still, Take A Chance isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a bad$
+name for a kid. When is he arriving?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He ought to be here now,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, looking at his watch. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+out and see.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He disappeared into the outer office, and presently returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The boy is here, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Would you like to see him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bring him in,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to meet this nephew, or$
+cousin, or whatever he is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He wondered vaguely what had induced him to take upon himself the$
+responsibility of the small child, and with remorseless judgment$
+analysed the reason as being personal vanity.$
+$
+The door opened and a child strode in. ‚M-^@M-^\Strode‚M-^@M-^] is the only word to$
+describe the quick, decisive movement of the bright-eyed lad who looked$
+with unflinching eye at Cartwright. Cartwright did not look at his$
+clothes, but at the grey, clear eyes, the firm mouth, extraordinarily$
+firm for a boy of fourteen, and the capable and not over-clean hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, son,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\So you‚M-^@M-^Yre my nephew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cousin, I think,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, critically examining the contents of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys table. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre Cousin Alfred, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym a cousin, am I? Yes, I suppose I am,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amused.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, ‚M-^@M-^\is that the school bill? The Head has been$
+rather baity about that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\‚M-^@M-^XBaity‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys a new one on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shirty,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy calmly. ‚M-^@M-^\Annoyed, I suppose, is the correct$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to be?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A financier,‚M-^@M-^] said T. A. C. Anderson promptly.$
+$
+He seated himself, leant his elbow on the desk and his head on his hand,$
+his eyes never leaving Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that‚M-^@M-^Ys a great scheme‚M-^@M-^Tfinance,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym a whale at$
+mathematics.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What particular branch of finance?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Other people‚M-^@M-^Ys finance,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy promptly; ‚M-^@M-^\the same business as$
+yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright threw back his head and laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And do you think you‚M-^@M-^Yd be able to keep twenty companies in the air at$
+the same time?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the air?‚M-^@M-^] the boy frowned. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, you mean going all at once? Rather!$
+Anyway, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The phrase struck Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take a chance? That‚M-^@M-^Ys curious. I called you Take A Chance Anderson just$
+before you came in.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, they all call me that,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,$
+they‚M-^@M-^Yre bound to stick a label on to a fellow with an initial like mine.$
+Some of them call me ‚M-^@M-^XTin and Copper Anderson,‚M-^@M-^Y but most of them‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a rum kid,‚M-^@M-^] said his cousin. ‚M-^@M-^\You can come to lunch with me.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+                               CHAPTER IV$
+$
+$
+MR. ALFRED CARTWRIGHT had the enviable faculty of placing outside of$
+his mind all subjects and persons which were unpleasant to think upon.$
+Possessing this power, he could as lightly dismiss the memory of$
+responsibilities, pleasant or unpleasant. He had scarcely left London$
+before he had waived Master T. A. C. Anderson into oblivion. To do him$
+justice, he had certainly speculated vaguely upon assuring his cousin‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+future; but his mind was so completely occupied with his own that there$
+was really not room for both‚M-^@M-^Tand Take A Chance Anderson had to go.$
+$
+He reached Paris by the evening train, and drove straight to the$
+apartment he had taken for his new prot√©g√©. He found her installed in a$
+very comfortable flat on the unfashionable side of the Seine, and was$
+welcomed with relief.$
+$
+Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had not entirely overcome her suspicions of the _bona$
+fides_ of her newfound acquaintance. Yet, since he had not made love to$
+her, but, on the contrary, had made it very clear that the part he$
+expected her to play in his schemes involved no loss of self-respect,$
+she was becoming reconciled to a relationship which, to say the least,$
+was a strange one. She had established herself in a third-floor office$
+on one of the boulevards, an uncomfortable and unaccustomed figure in an$
+environment which was wholly foreign to her experience, though there was$
+no need for her embarrassment, since she constituted the whole of the$
+staff, and the callers were confined to the postman and the concierge$
+who acted as office-cleaner.$
+$
+She was to learn, however, that a daily attendance at her ‚M-^@M-^\bureau‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute the whole of her duties, or fulfil all Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+requirements.$
+$
+It was not until after dinner that night that Cartwright revealed$
+himself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sadie, my young friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, between puffs of his cigar, ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+going to tell you just what I want you to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought I knew,‚M-^@M-^] she said, on her guard, and he laughed softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll never quite know what I want you to do,‚M-^@M-^] he said frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\until$
+I tell you. Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting it to you very straight. I want nothing$
+from you except service. And the service I require is of a kind which$
+you need not hesitate to give me. You‚M-^@M-^Yre an actress, and I can speak to$
+you more plainly than I could to some unsophisticated girl.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She wondered what was coming, but had not long to wait.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will tell you something,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\which is really more important$
+than my name, about which you showed so much curiosity. There is a man$
+in this city whom I want to get at.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is a man who has it in his power to ruin me‚M-^@M-^Ta drunken sot of a$
+fellow, without brain or imagination.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He went on to explain briefly that he himself was a company promoter,$
+and that he had an interest in a mine, as yet unproved, in Morocco.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is why you were there?‚M-^@M-^] she nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is exactly why,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Unfortunately, right in the$
+midst of the ground which I have either bought or secured mineral rights$
+over, is a block of land which is the property of this man. He is a$
+Spaniard‚M-^@M-^Tdo you speak Spanish?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is precious little!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt matter,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright shook his head. ‚M-^@M-^\He speaks English very$
+well. Now, this land is absolutely valueless to the man, but every$
+attempt I have made to buy it has been unsuccessful, and it is vitally$
+necessary at this moment, when I am floating a company to develop the$
+property, that his claims should be included in my properties.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his name?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] repeated Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\I seem to have heard$
+that name before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is pretty common in France, but not so common in Spain,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr.$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And what am I to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will get you an introduction to him,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys a man$
+with a fine eye for beauty, and in the hands of a clever girl could be$
+wound round her little finger.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see what you mean,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but nothing doing!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have told you that it is necessary for me to$
+acquire this property. I am taking you into my confidence, and I know$
+that you will respect that confidence. I am willing to pay any$
+reasonable sum, and I neither want you to steal it nor make any personal$
+sacrifice to serve my ends. I am willing to pay, and pay heavily.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you call heavily?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl coolly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For the property twenty thousand‚M-^@M-^Tfor you ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^]$
+suggested Cartwright, and the girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys got me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Tell me what your plan is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My plan is this,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\You will appear to Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^TI$
+will arrange that‚M-^@M-^Tas a wealthy young American lady who has been$
+spending the winter in Morocco. His property follows a little wooded$
+hill, one of the prettiest formations of its kind in the Angera country.$
+You must rave about that hill, never cease speaking of its beauty and$
+its attractiveness; and you must tell him that you would give anything$
+in the world if you could build a house amidst that beautiful$
+scenery‚M-^@M-^Tdo you understand me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is a man somewhat susceptible to feminine charms,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright$
+went on, ‚M-^@M-^\and, unless I am greatly mistaken, he will in one of his$
+obliging moods, offer you the land at a nominal figure, particularly as$
+he has been bitterly disappointed in his attempt to find gold.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl after consideration. ‚M-^@M-^\You promised me$
+that if I came to Paris you would get me a job in one of the theatres.$
+That is what I am after, and the only thing I am fit for. The other$
+business doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt seem decent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds!‚M-^@M-^] murmured Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a lot,‚M-^@M-^] agreed the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but how am I coming out of this$
+business? I come out hopelessly compromised.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait a moment,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly; ‚M-^@M-^\let‚M-^@M-^Ys have a clear understanding.$
+You don‚M-^@M-^Yt expect me to walk up to Se√±or Brigot the first time I meet$
+him, or even the second, and say: ‚M-^@M-^XYou‚M-^@M-^Yve a very nice property. What$
+will you sell it for?‚M-^@M-^Y That is not the kind of transaction you expect me$
+to conduct, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means just a little more than you say,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\it means$
+dinners and suppers and hand-holdings and stringing him along. And after$
+it is all over, where am I? I‚M-^@M-^Yve got as much respect for my character as$
+you have for yours, Mr. Mysterious. I want to come out well in this$
+business as you do, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to leave my name behind, or be$
+known in Paris‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the world‚M-^@M-^Tas a decoy duck. I‚M-^@M-^Yd do an awful lot$
+to please you, because I like you and because you‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me.$
+But ‚M-^@M-^Xan awful lot‚M-^@M-^Y does not mean making me so cheap that I am left in$
+the slightly-soiled basket. Do you understand what I mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amazed at the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys cool reasoning. He$
+had not given her credit for any of these fine sentiments she now$
+enunciated, and he was piqued, and at the same time a little pleased.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When you said you‚M-^@M-^Yd give me ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+sounded good. But it is not good enough. I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea in the back of my$
+mind that the matter is a much bigger one for you than you‚M-^@M-^Yve told me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How big do you imagine?‚M-^@M-^] bantered Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think it is big enough to ruin you,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\and that$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yd be willing to pay any price to get this property. Otherwise, you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+go to the man or send your lawyer in the ordinary way. Now, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want$
+your ten thousand pounds, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to make a proposition to you.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve said I like you and that‚M-^@M-^Ys no more than the truth. You told me you$
+were a bachelor and I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you that I‚M-^@M-^Ym man-free and heart-free. I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt say I love you, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt flatter myself that you love me. But$
+if you want this thing to go through, and if you want me to go down in$
+the mud to get it, you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to pay the price‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And the price is‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to marry me,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright could only gasp his admiration; and then he$
+began to laugh, at first quietly, and then, as the humour of the$
+situation gained upon him, so loudly that the other patrons of the Caf√©$
+Scribe turned to look at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a rum idea,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, keeping her eyes on his.$
+$
+He nodded to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a bargain!‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She looked at him as she put out her hand and took his, and slowly shook$
+her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My!‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You want that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys land pretty badly, _I_ know!‚M-^@M-^]$
+and Cartwright began to laugh again.$

+$
+Se√±or Brigot lived in some style for a man who was on the verge of ruin.$
+He had a small house at Maisons Lafitte and a flat on the Boulevard$
+Webber. He was a heavy, tired-looking man, with a dark moustache,$
+obviously dyed, and a short beard, bearing evidence of the same$
+attention. M. Brigot, like Mr. Cartwright, had many interests; but his$
+chief interests were his own tastes and predilections. It was Se√±or$
+Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys boast that, although he had lived for twenty years in Paris, he$
+had never seen Paris between the hours of six in the morning and one in$
+the afternoon. His breakfast hour was two o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. By six o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the$
+evening he was becoming interested in life; and at the hour when most$
+people retire to rest, he was in the prime of his day.$
+$
+It happened on a certain evening that M. Brigot, who usually met dinner$
+in an amicable frame of mind, sat down at his favourite table at the$
+Abbaye with a big frown, and answered the polite _ma√Ætre d‚M-^@M-^Yh√¥tel‚M-^@M-^Ys_$
+cheery ‚M-^@M-^\Good evening‚M-^@M-^] with a snarl.$
+$
+Amongst his many enterprises and few possessions, and this Mr.$
+Cartwright did not know, was the proprietorship and management of a$
+small, ramshackle wooden theatre in the town of Tangier. He was likewise$
+interested in several cabarets throughout Spain. But what pained him$
+most at the moment was not distressing reports from any of these, but a$
+six-page letter received that afternoon from his son, in which the hope$
+of the house of Brigot had explained his reasons for discharging$
+immediately a very necessary servant. Therefore Se√±or Brigot swore under$
+his breath and cursed his first-born.$
+$
+Coincident with the arrival of the letter had come one Jose Ferreira,$
+who had been detained for a week at Madrid. Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys mind was$
+occupied with Jose Ferreira when that worthy, smirking apologetically,$
+as though conscious of the shabbiness of his dress-clothes, sidled into$
+a seat on the opposite side of the table. Se√±or Brigot glared at him a$
+moment, and Jose Ferreira shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had telegraphed to me, I would have settled the matter,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Brigot, as though carrying on a conversation which he had broken off a$
+few minutes before. ‚M-^@M-^\Instead, like the fool you are, you come all the$
+way to Paris, wasting your time in Madrid, and the first I hear of the$
+matter is from my son.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was deplorable,‚M-^@M-^] murmured Jose, ‚M-^@M-^\but Don Brigot‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot!‚M-^@M-^] sneered the father of that worthy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot is a$
+monkey! Why did you take notice of him? Have you nothing else to do in$
+Tangier but to look after that flea-ridden theatre? Have you no other$
+duties?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The young se√±or was emphatic,‚M-^@M-^] murmured the apologetic Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\He$
+demanded that I should leave and what could I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot grunted something uncomplimentary. Whether it was intended for$
+his son or for Ferreira, it was difficult to say. Ferreira was content$
+to take it to himself.$
+$
+Half-way through the dinner Brigot became more human.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will always be quarrels about women, my good Jose, and it is your$
+business to be diplomatic,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\My son is a fool; but then, all$
+young men are fools. Why should you neglect my interests because Emanuel$
+is a bigger fool than ever? Only this week I intended travelling to$
+Tangier with the representative of a very rich syndicate who wishes to$
+buy my land.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same se√±or as before?‚M-^@M-^] asked the interested Jose, who was not only$
+the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, but was also the representative of the$
+rusty little gold-mining company which Brigot had floated.$
+$
+The other nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same cursed Englishman,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Quite unconscious of the fact that his master was cursing the very man$
+whom Jose had most recently cursed, the little man smiled$
+sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I also have a hatred of the English,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\With what insolence do$
+they treat one!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+For some time M. Brigot sat in silence, but presently he wiped his mouth$
+on his napkin, tossed down a tumbler of red wine, and crooked his finger$
+at his companion, inviting closer attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a day, or perhaps two, I shall send you back to Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] began Jose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre‚M-^@M-^Tbah!‚M-^@M-^] exclaimed the other scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\A donkey-driver$
+could look after the theatre! It is the mine!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The mine?‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other in some astonishment.$
+$
+So long had it been since a spade had been put to the ground, so long$
+had those hopes of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys been apparently dead, that the very word$
+‚M-^@M-^\mine‚M-^@M-^] had ceased to be employed when referring to the property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My Englishman will buy it,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot confidently. ‚M-^@M-^\I happen to know$
+that he has taken up property in the neighbourhood, and he has already$
+made me an offer. But such an offer! He shall pay my price, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, nodding as he picked his teeth, ‚M-^@M-^\and it will be a big price,$
+because it is desirable that I should have money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose did not ask the price, but his employer saved him the trouble.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Five million pesetas,‚M-^@M-^] he said confidently; ‚M-^@M-^\for such a price the$
+property will be sold, always providing, my friend, that we do not$
+discover gold before the sale.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose smiled weakly, a circumstance which seemed to annoy his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot irritably; ‚M-^@M-^\you have no brains! You think$
+that is a preposterous sum? Wait!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When his subordinate‚M-^@M-^Ys dinner was finished, Jose was dismissed$
+peremptorily. Brigot had a round of calls to make, a succession of$
+people to be visited; and whilst he might interview the little man at$
+dinner without losing caste, he had no desire to take him round to his$
+usual haunts.$
+$
+It was at the Abbaye at that golden hour when the price of wine soars$
+and all that is smartest in Paris is assembled in the big saloon, that$
+M. Brigot, who had reached a stage of geniality, met an entrancing$
+vision. Brigot saw the girl and her cavalier at one of the tables, and$
+recognised in the latter a well-known man about town. The latter caught$
+his eye and walked across to him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is your charming companion?‚M-^@M-^] whispered Brigot, whose failing was,$
+as Cartwright accurately surmised, a weakness for pretty faces.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is an American lady who has just come from Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+glibly.$
+$
+Cartwright had chosen Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys companion very well. In a few$
+minutes Brigot had crossed to the other table and taken a seat, was$
+introduced, and was in that pleasant glow of mind which comes to the man$
+of his class who is conscious of having made an impression.$
+$
+This ‚M-^@M-^\American widow,‚M-^@M-^] with her queer, broken French, her beautiful$
+eyes, and the charming distinction which goes best with good clothes,$
+was more lovely than any woman he had ever met‚M-^@M-^Tso he swore to himself,$
+as he had sworn before. The friendship progressed from day to day, and$
+so great was the impression which the girl had made, that Brigot was$
+seen abroad at most unusual hours.$
+$
+The patient Jose Ferreira was despatched on a mission to Madrid, partly$
+because Brigot was tired of seeing him hanging about, and partly because$
+there was some genuine business to be done in the capital.$
+$
+Sadie reported progress to her employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, yes, he‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy enough about me,‚M-^@M-^] she said complacently, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going a little crazy myself. How long is this to go on?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another week?‚M-^@M-^] suggested Cartwright, smiling approvingly at the gloom$
+on the pretty face. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you mentioned the fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve taken a$
+fancy to his land?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wanted to give it to me there and then,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but you know$
+what these Spaniards are. If I had accepted, there would have been$
+nothing for me but the front door.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right,‚M-^@M-^] agreed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He is the kind of fish you must play.$
+Did he say anything about other offers he had received for the$
+property?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He spoke about you,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\he called you Benson‚M-^@M-^Tis that your real$
+name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is good enough,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is queer,‚M-^@M-^] mused the girl, looking at him thoughtfully, ‚M-^@M-^\that I$
+never meet any of your friends in Paris, and that nobody knows you‚M-^@M-^Tby$
+name. I went down to your flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+confessed frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\and asked the concierge. You‚M-^@M-^Yre Benson there too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In my business,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary that one should be discreet.$
+The name which goes in London is not good enough for Paris. And _vice$
+versa_,‚M-^@M-^] he added.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a strange man. I suppose if you marry me in the name of Benson$
+it will be legal?‚M-^@M-^] she asked dubiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it will be legal. I‚M-^@M-^Ym surprised at a girl of your$
+intelligence asking such a question,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What is the$
+programme for to-night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled a little face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Marigny and supper at Corbets‚M-^@M-^Tsupper in a private dining-room.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it‚M-^@M-^Ys come to that, has it? Well, you ought to make good to-night,$
+Sadie. Remember, I am willing to pay up to fifty thousand pounds. It is$
+going to be a tough job raising that money, and it will break my heart$
+to pay it. But it will not only break my heart, but it will break me$
+everlastingly and confoundedly to pay the man‚M-^@M-^Ys own price‚M-^@M-^Tand his$
+property must be bought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll do my best,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have no doubt in your mind$
+that it is going to be hard.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+At one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock the next morning he sat reading in his room, when a knock$
+came to his door and the girl came in. She was half hysterical, but the$
+light of triumph was in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it!‚M-^@M-^] he repeated in wonder. ‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean he sold?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For ten thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthree hundred thousand francs. What do you$
+think of your little Sadie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you serious?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+She hesitated and closed her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt talk about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have to see him to-morrow at$
+his lawyers, and the property will be transferred to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She smiled grimly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The after-part will not be as pleasant as M. Brigot imagines,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I tell you, that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy‚M-^@M-^Tstark, staring mad. But I felt$
+an awful beast, and I think he‚M-^@M-^Yll kill me when he discovers I‚M-^@M-^Yve sold$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that worry you,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright easily.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER V$
+$
+$
+HE saw the girl down to her waiting auto, and went back to his rooms$
+to think. It was curious that at that hour, when the big trouble on his$
+mind seemed likely to roll away, that his thoughts flew instantly to$
+Maxell. What would the prim Maxell say, if he knew? He was satisfied$
+that Maxell would not only disapprove, but would instantly and without$
+notice sever all connection with the adventurous company promoter.$
+Maxell would be outraged, appalled. Cartwright smiled at the thought.$
+$
+He was under no illusion as to his own conduct. He knew he was acting$
+despicably; but this view he dismissed from his mind as being too$
+unpleasant for contemplation. Maxell was a prig‚M-^@M-^Ta necessary prig, but$
+none the less priggish. He was necessary, at any rate, to Cartwright.$
+Anyway, Maxell stood to win if the scheme went through.$
+$
+Cartwright had reached nearly the end of his financial tether, and his$
+whole future was bound up in the success or failure of the new$
+promotion. He had exhausted every bit of his credit in order to take up$
+the Angera property which he knew was rich in gold, and offered$
+possibilities which no project of his had offered before.$
+$
+He had milked his other companies dry, he had played with reserves; all$
+except his Anglo-Parisian Finance Company, where the directors were too$
+strong to allow him his own way; and, although Maxell was not aware of$
+the fact, his ‚M-^@M-^\partner‚M-^@M-^] had spent fabulous sums, not only in acquiring$
+the land itself but in purchasing other gold-mining property in the$
+region. It was a gamble, and a dangerous gamble. He was risking the$
+substance of his fortune for the shadow of unlimited wealth.$
+$
+Yet, was it a risk? he asked himself; with the properties that he could$
+include in his new North Morocco Gold Mining Association‚M-^@M-^Tthat was to be$
+the title of the new company‚M-^@M-^Tthere could be no doubt as to the result$
+of the public issue. The British public dearly love a gamble, and a$
+gold-mining gamble, with all its mysteries and uncertainties, more$
+dearly than any.$
+$
+He went to bed late, but was taking his chocolate and roll before a$
+little caf√© on the boulevard before nine. At half-past nine he was$
+joined by the girl.$
+$
+Cartwright had been undecided as to whether he should take his _petit$
+d√©jeuner_ outside or inside the caf√©, and had decided, since the morning$
+was bright and warm, to breakfast under the striped awning in full view$
+of the street. Such great events hang upon slight issues.$
+$
+Scarcely had the girl seated herself opposite to him, when a pedestrian,$
+passing on the other side of the boulevard, halted and stared. Mr.$
+Ferreira had sharp eyes and a wit not altogether dulled by his$
+monotonous occupation.$
+$
+Cartwright produced a bulky package from his pocket and laid it on the$
+table before the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put that in your bag and be careful with it,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\there are three$
+hundred thousand francs in notes. When the property is transferred to$
+you, you must bring the transfer along to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about your promise?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I will keep,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that you have the best$
+guarantee in the possession of the transfer. Legally, it is your$
+property until it is made over to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She sat looking at the package absently, and presently she said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to get me out of Paris at once. Otherwise I am due to leave$
+by the Sud Express‚M-^@M-^Twith Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is a train for Havre at two-fifteen,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He saw her into her car‚M-^@M-^Tanother indiscretion since it brought him out$
+of the shadow which the awning afforded, and gave the observer on the$
+other side of the road an unmistakable view.$
+$
+Brigot was waiting for her‚M-^@M-^Ta heavy-eyed, weary-looking man, whose hand$
+shook whenever it rose to stroke his short, pointed beard.$
+$
+His lawyer watched him curiously as he stepped forward to meet the girl$
+with hands outstretched. It was not the first time that he had seen his$
+client overwhelmed by a pretty face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything is ready, Nanette,‚M-^@M-^] said the eager M. Brigot. (‚M-^@M-^\Nanette‚M-^@M-^] was$
+the newfound name which Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady employed for this adventure.) ‚M-^@M-^\See$
+here, I have all the documents ready!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I have the money,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the girl as she put the package down on$
+the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The money!‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Brigot waved such sordid matters out of existence$
+with a magnificent flourish. ‚M-^@M-^\What is money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Count it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will do no such thing,‚M-^@M-^] said the other extravagantly. ‚M-^@M-^\As a$
+caballero, it hurts me to discuss money in connection‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But his lawyer had no sentiment, and had slipped the string from the$
+package and was now busily counting the thousand-franc notes. When he$
+had finished, he put them on the desk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you one moment, M. Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Brigot, holding the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and devouring her with his eyes, turned$
+impatiently.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The document, my friend, the document! Give me a$
+pen!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is one point in the deed I must discuss,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer firmly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\if mademoiselle will excuse us for a moment‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He opened the door of$
+his inner office invitingly and with a shrug M. Brigot followed him in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have told you, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\that I do not think your$
+action is wise. You are surrendering a property for a sum less than a$
+quarter of what you paid for it to a perfectly unknown woman‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\M. l‚M-^@M-^YAvocat,‚M-^@M-^] said the other gravely, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a lady who$
+to me is more precious than life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer concealed a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have often spoken to you about ladies who have been more precious to$
+you than life,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly, ‚M-^@M-^\but in their cases, no transfer of$
+valuable property was involved. What do you know of this lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know nothing except that she is adorable,‚M-^@M-^] said the reckless$
+Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\But for the fact that, alas! my wife most obstinately refuses$
+to die or divorce me, I should be honoured to make madame my wife. As it$
+is, what a pleasure to give her the land on which to build a beautiful$
+villa overlooking my gorgeous Tangier‚M-^@M-^TI am moving to Tangier very soon$
+to look after my other property‚M-^@M-^Tand to know that her blessed$
+presence‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer spread out despairing hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then there is nothing to be done,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I only tell you that you$
+are transferring a valuable property to a lady who is comparatively$
+unknown to you, and it seems to me a very indiscreet and reckless thing$
+to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They returned again to the outer apartment, where the girl had been$
+standing nervously twisting the moir√© bag in her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is the document, madame,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer to her relief. ‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or$
+Brigot will sign here‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The indicated a line‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and you will sign there. I$
+will cause these signatures to be witnessed, and a copy of the document$
+will be forwarded for registration.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl sat down at the table, and her hand shook as she took up the$
+pen. It was at that moment that Jose Ferreira dashed into the room.$
+$
+He stood open-mouthed at sight of the girl at the table. He tried to$
+speak, but the sound died in his throat. Then he strode forward, under$
+the glaring eye of his employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This woman‚M-^@M-^Tthis woman!‚M-^@M-^] he gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] cried Brigot in a terrible voice, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a$
+lady who is my friend!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Tshe‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthe man pointed to her with shaking finger‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\she is the$
+woman! She escaped! . . . The woman I told you of, who ran away with an$
+Englishman from Tangier!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot stared from one to the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre mad,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is the woman,‚M-^@M-^] squeaked Ferreira, ‚M-^@M-^\and the man also is in Paris. I$
+saw them together this morning at the Caf√© Furnos! The man who was in$
+Tangier, of whom I told the se√±or, and this woman, Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot looked at the girl. She had been caught off her guard, and never$
+once had the keen eyes of the lawyer left her. Given some warning, she$
+might have dissembled and carried the matter through with a high hand.$
+But the suddenness of the accusation, the amazingly unexpected vision of$
+Jose, had thrown her off her guard, and Brigot did not need to look$
+twice at her to know that the charges of his subordinate were justified.$
+She was not a born conspirator, nor was she used to intrigues of this$
+character.$
+$
+Brigot gripped her by the arm and pulled her from the chair. He was half$
+mad with rage and humiliation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the name of this man?‚M-^@M-^] he hissed. ‚M-^@M-^\The name of the man who took$
+you from Tangier and brought you here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was white as death and terribly afraid.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson,‚M-^@M-^] she stammered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer and Brigot uttered the words together, and the Spaniard,$
+releasing his hold stepped back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it was Benson!‚M-^@M-^] he said softly. ‚M-^@M-^\Our wonderful Englishman who wanted$
+to swindle me out of my property, eh? And I suppose he sent you, my$
+beautiful American widow, to purchase land for your villa! Now, you can$
+go back to Mr. Benson and tell him that, if my property is good enough$
+for him to buy, it is good enough for me to keep. You‚M-^@M-^Tyou!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He made a dart at her with upraised hand, but the lawyer was before him$
+and gently pushed him back.$
+$
+He jerked his head to the girl and, shaking like a leaf, she stepped to$
+the door and went stumbling down the stairs, which she had mounted with$
+such confidence a few minutes before.$
+$
+Cartwright received the news with extraordinary equanimity.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has saved us the bother of going out of Paris,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\And it was my own fault. I never connected that infernal$
+fellow Ferreira with Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises. And anyway, we should not$
+have met in public. He said he saw us at the caf√©, did he?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did my best,‚M-^@M-^] she faltered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you did your best,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, patting her hand. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+tough luck, but it can‚M-^@M-^Yt be helped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was a long silence, then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about me?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Where do I come in? I suppose you have$
+no further use for my services?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course I have,‚M-^@M-^] he said genially. Then, after a longer pause, ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know that you‚M-^@M-^Yre the only person in this world that I have ever$
+taken so completely into my confidence and shown what, for a better$
+expression, I will call the seamy side of my business? I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to tell$
+you a lot more, because it would be a relief to me to get it off my$
+chest. But I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling you this, that if I marry you to-day, you‚M-^@M-^Yll have$
+to play your part to save me from everlasting ruin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ruin?‚M-^@M-^] she said, startled, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not the kind of ruin that means you‚M-^@M-^Yll go short of food,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but$
+the sort of ruin that may mean‚M-^@M-^Twell, ruin from my point of view. Now$
+you must understand this thing clearly, Sadie. I‚M-^@M-^Ym out for a big stake,$
+and if I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pull it off, it‚M-^@M-^Ys as likely as not that I‚M-^@M-^Yll go out.$
+You‚M-^@M-^Yre a clever, useful sort of kid, and I have an idea that you may be$
+even more useful. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys to be no sentiment in this marriage, mind!$
+You have just to sit here and hold tight and do as you‚M-^@M-^Yre told, and you$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got to pry into my business any further than I want you to. And$
+if I go away and don‚M-^@M-^Yt come back, you must reckon me as dead. I‚M-^@M-^Yve a lot$
+of business in America and elsewhere, which often takes me away for$
+months at a time, and you‚M-^@M-^Yre not to get uneasy. But if you don‚M-^@M-^Yt hear$
+from me‚M-^@M-^Twhy, you can go down to the Lafayette and buy yourself the$
+grandest little suit of mourning that you can afford!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I be able to afford it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall put some Rentes to your credit at the Lyonnais. That will give$
+you a steady income in case anything happens.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was troubled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite like this idea,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What will happen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Cartwright flicked away the ash from the end of his cigar and said$
+cheerfully:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That depends entirely upon the view which is taken of a certain$
+prospectus issued in London this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER VI$
+$
+$
+THE New Angera Syndicate was registered as a private company, and its$
+prospectus was not made public. Officially, the shares were not offered$
+to general subscription, and actually they had been subscribed‚M-^@M-^Tor the$
+first issue of five hundred thousand had‚M-^@M-^Tby a little group of shrewd$
+speculators in the City of London, who, before now, had made vast sums$
+from Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys promotions. The five hundred thousand shares brought$
+in about half that number of pounds, and nobody doubted that the$
+properties consolidated for the purposes of flotation included the block$
+of claims described in the prospectus as ‚M-^@M-^\lately the property of Se√±or$
+Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Gold had been found on the Angera reef, and gold in sufficient quantity$
+to make the new company a very promising speculation. That Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+property could be made to pay, had it been properly managed, was common$
+knowledge in the City of London. A dozen offers had been made for this$
+concession, but none had been quite acceptable to Se√±or Brigot, whose$
+estimate of the value of the mine varied with the passing hour.$
+$
+Probably, had it been possible to secure an interview with M. Brigot at$
+one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the afternoon, when he arose with a splitting head and a$
+dry throat, his possessions might have been acquired at the price of a$
+quart of sweet champagne.$
+$
+But, as the day progressed and his views of life became more charitable,$
+his estimate expanded until, by seven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the evening, which hour$
+he as a rule reserved for any business discussion, his figure was$
+awe-inspiring. Nobody in the City doubted for one moment that Cartwright$
+had purchased the property. Though his system of finance might not$
+commend itself to the barons and even the baronets of Capel Court, there$
+was no question of his honesty.$
+$
+Was it by some extraordinary fluke that Maxell, who had hitherto shared$
+in the profits of promotion, had kept aloof from this last and greatest$
+of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys flutters? No application for shares was ever found. He$
+heard (he said at a subsequent inquiry) in a round-about way of the$
+flotation, and saw a copy of the prospectus, and was a little worried.$
+He knew that when he had left Cartwright in Paris, not only was the$
+Brigot mine outside of his friend‚M-^@M-^Ys control, but there was precious$
+little prospect of bringing the Spaniard to a reasonable frame of mind.$
+$
+Cartwright must have done his work quickly, he thought, and have paid$
+heavily; and this latter reflection worried him even more because he had$
+a fairly accurate idea as to the condition of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private$
+finances. His private thoughts on this occasion are set forth in the$
+report of the Attorney-General‚M-^@M-^Ys Committee of Investigation.$
+$
+He was eating his solitary dinner in Cavendish Square when the telephone$
+bell rang and the voice of Sir Gregory Fane, the Attorney-General,$
+saluted him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should like to see you, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you come round to$
+Clarges Street after dinner?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Certainly,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell promptly, and hung up the receiver,$
+wondering what new difficulties had arisen, which called for a$
+consultation; for he was not on visiting terms with Mr. Attorney.$
+$
+In the tiny drawing-room of the house occupied by the Cabinet Minister,$
+Maxell was surprised to find another visitor waiting‚M-^@M-^Tno less a person$
+than Fenshaw, the Prime Minister‚M-^@M-^Ys private secretary.$
+$
+The Attorney-General came straight to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\we want your seat in the House of Commons.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The deuce you do!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, raising his eyebrows.$
+$
+The Attorney nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We also want to give you some reward for the excellent services you$
+have rendered to the Government,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But mostly‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This eyes$
+twinkled‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary to find a seat for Sir Milton Boyd‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+Minister of Education has been defeated at a by-election, as you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded. The communication was a surprise to him and he$
+wondered exactly what position was to be offered him which would involve$
+his resignation from the House. For one brief, panicky moment he had$
+connected Cartwright and his delinquencies with this request for an$
+interview, but the Attorney‚M-^@M-^Ys speech had dispelled that momentary fear.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quilland, as you know, has been raised to the Court of Appeal,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the Attorney, speaking of a well-known Chancery Judge, ‚M-^@M-^\and we are$
+departing from our usual practice by bringing over a man from the King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Bench to take his place. Now, Maxell, how does a judgeship appeal to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The K.C. could only stare.$
+$
+Of the many things he did not expect, it was elevation to the Bench,$
+although he was a sound, good lawyer, and the Bench is the ambition of$
+every silk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good!‚M-^@M-^] said the brisk Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\Then we will regard it as settled. The$
+appointment will not be announced for two or three days, so you‚M-^@M-^Yve a$
+chance of clearing up your more urgent work and preparing a letter for$
+your constituents. You might say a kind word for the new candidate who$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt particularly popular in your part of the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+One of Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys first acts was to write a letter to Cartwright. All$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys correspondence went to his London office, and was forwarded$
+under separate cover to Paris. It was a long letter, recapitulating$
+their friendly relationship, and ending:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This promotion, of course, means that we can no longer be$
+    associated in business, and I have instructed my broker to sell$
+    all the shares I possess in your and other companies forthwith.$
+    As you know, I have very definite views about the high prestige$
+    of the Bench; and whilst, in any circumstances, I feel that I$
+    can go to that dignified position with clean hands, my mind will$
+    be freer if I cut all the cords which hold me to commerce of$
+    every shape and description.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Three days later the letter came to Cartwright, and he read it through$
+with a thoughtful expression on his face. He read it twice before he$
+slowly folded it and put it into his inside pocket.$
+$
+Maxell was to be made a Judge!$
+$
+He had never considered that contingency, and did not know whether to be$
+pleased or sorry. He was losing the service of a man who had been a$
+directing force in his life, greater than Maxell himself ever imagined.$
+It was not so much the advice which he asked and received from the$
+King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel, but rather Cartwright had secured help by the simple$
+process of making a study of the other‚M-^@M-^Ys moods and expressions.$
+$
+He knew the half-frown which greeted some schemes, put forward$
+tentatively over the dinner table, and it was that little sign of$
+displeasure which could squash the scheme rather than any considered$
+advice which Maxell might have given. He was losing a good advocate, a$
+very sound legal adviser. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, it did not$
+matter very much. Fate had put a period to an old phase of life, and$
+many things had come to an end coincidently. He was taking his afternoon$
+tea when the letter had arrived, and the new Mrs. Cartwright marked with$
+interest the depression which followed the arrival of the mail.$
+$
+The new period was beginning excitingly, he thought. He had found a new$
+method of doing business, bolder and more desperate than any he had$
+attempted before; and with this development he had lost a man upon whom$
+he placed a great deal of reliance. Incidentally, he had just been$
+married, but this fact did not bulk very largely in his reckoning.$
+Maxell might serve him yet. The memory of an old business$
+partnership‚M-^@M-^Tfor in such an aspect did Cartwright interpret their$
+previous relationship‚M-^@M-^Tthe memory, too, of favours done, of financial$
+dangers shared, might serve him well if things went wrong. Maxell had a$
+pull with the Government‚M-^@M-^Ta greater pull, since he was now a Judge of$
+the Supreme Court.$
+$
+Maxell a Judge! It seemed queer. Cartwright had all the properly$
+constituted Englishman‚M-^@M-^Ys reverence for the Bench. In spite of much$
+experience in litigation, and an acquaintance with lawyers of all kinds$
+and stations, he reserved his awe for the god-like creature who sat in$
+wig and gown, and dispensed justice evenhandedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you had a worrying letter?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said, a little impatiently; ‚M-^@M-^\it is nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She had hoped for a glimpse of the envelope, but was disappointed.$
+Curiously enough, she ascribed the fact that her husband passed under a$
+strange name and would not divulge his own, to a cause which was far$
+from the truth, and was a great injustice to a man who, if he had not$
+given her his proper name, had given her a title to whatever name he$
+had. That thought she revealed for the first time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know what I think?‚M-^@M-^] she said unexpectedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you thought very much,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\In what particular$
+department of speculation does your mind wander?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] she answered. She was a little afraid of sarcasm,$
+as are all children and immature grown-ups. ‚M-^@M-^\It was about your name I$
+was thinking.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why the dickens don‚M-^@M-^Yt you leave my name alone?‚M-^@M-^] he snapped. ‚M-^@M-^\I have$
+told you that it is all for your good that I‚M-^@M-^Ym called Benson and known$
+as Benson in this town. When we go to London you will discover my name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know why you keep it dark.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why do I keep it dark?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, fixing his eyes on her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre married already.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her for a moment, and then burst into such a peal of$
+laughter that the girl knew her shot was wide of the mark.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a weird person,‚M-^@M-^] he said, getting up. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going out to see an$
+old friend of ours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of ours?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is the gentleman‚M-^@M-^Ys name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He won‚M-^@M-^Yt see you,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, won‚M-^@M-^Yt he?‚M-^@M-^] said the grim man. ‚M-^@M-^\I rather think he will.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot would not willingly have received one whose name was anathema,$
+but Cartwright got over the difficulty of his reception by the simple$
+process of sending up a card inscribed with the name of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys lawyer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You!‚M-^@M-^] spluttered M. Brigot, rising to his feet as the other entered the$
+room and closed the door behind him. ‚M-^@M-^\This is an outrage! It is$
+monstrous! You will leave this house immediately, or I will send for the$
+police!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, just keep quiet for a moment, Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, seating$
+himself coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see you as one business man to another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I refuse to discuss any business with you,‚M-^@M-^] stormed his unwilling host.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a scoundrel, a conspirator‚M-^@M-^Tbah! why do I talk to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre broke!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in calm, level tones, and he$
+used the Spanish word for ‚M-^@M-^\broke,‚M-^@M-^] which is so much more expressive than$
+any word in English.$
+$
+The conversation was carried on in this language, for Cartwright had an$
+intimate knowledge of its idioms and even of its patois.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your creditors in Paris are gathering round like hawks about a dead$
+cow. Your attempt to sell your Moorish property has been a failure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know a great deal,‚M-^@M-^] sneered Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Possibly you also know that I$
+am going to work the mine myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard that said of you for years,‚M-^@M-^] said he, ‚M-^@M-^\but the truth is,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre wholly incapable of working anything. You‚M-^@M-^Yre one of nature‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+little spenders‚M-^@M-^Tnow, Brigot, don‚M-^@M-^Yt let us quarrel. There is a time to$
+end feuds like ours, and this is that time. I am a business man, and so$
+are you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre as anxious to sell your property at a good price as I am$
+to buy it. I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to make you an offer.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot laughed sarcastically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded with gentle irony. ‚M-^@M-^\To build a house$
+for a beautiful American widow, eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright accepted the gibe with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to show you my hand,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will be infamously dirty,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot, who was in his bright six$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock mood.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know there is gold in the Angera,‚M-^@M-^] the other went on, without$
+troubling to notice the interruption, ‚M-^@M-^\and I know that, properly worked,$
+your mine may pay big profits.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will sell out,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot after consideration, ‚M-^@M-^\but at a price.$
+I have told you before I will sell out‚M-^@M-^Tat a price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But what a price!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, raising his eyebrows and with a$
+gesture of extravagant despair. ‚M-^@M-^\It is all the money in the world!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nevertheless, it is the price,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot comfortably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you what I am willing to do.‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright stroked his chin as$
+though the solution had just occurred to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I will float your$
+property in London, tacking on a number of other properties which I have$
+bought in the neighbourhood. I am willing to pay you two hundred$
+thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, six million francs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot was interested. He was so interested that, for the moment, he$
+could forget his animosity and private grievances. It was true that, as$
+Cartwright had said, his creditors were becoming noisy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In cash, of course?‚M-^@M-^] he said suddenly.$
+$
+Cartwright shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can have a portion in cash and the rest in shares.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] Brigot snapped his fingers. ‚M-^@M-^\I also can issue shares, my friend.$
+What are shares? Pieces of paper which are not worth their ink. No, no,$
+you deceive me. I thought you had come to me with a genuine offer. There$
+is no business to be done between you and me, Mr. Cartwright. Good$
+evening.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not move.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A portion in cash‚M-^@M-^Tsay, fifteen thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he suggested; ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+is a lot of money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To you‚M-^@M-^Tyes, but not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said the magnificent Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Give me$
+two-thirds in cash and I will take the rest in shares. That is my last$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This offer is open until‚M-^@M-^Twhen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Until to-morrow at this hour,‚M-^@M-^] replied Brigot.$
+$
+As Cartwright was going, a man tapped at the door. It was Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+‚M-^@M-^\secretary,‚M-^@M-^] who was also his valet. He handed a telegram to the$
+Spaniard, and Brigot opened and read. He was a long time digesting its$
+contents, and Cartwright waited for a favourable opportunity to say$
+good-bye. All the time his mind was working, and he thought he saw$
+daylight. Two-thirds of the money could be raised, and he could breathe$
+again.$
+$
+Presently Brigot folded up the telegram and put it in his pocket, and$
+there was on his face a beatific smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good night, Se√±or Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I will see you to-morrow$
+with the money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will have to be big money, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot, and there was a$
+note of exultation in his voice. ‚M-^@M-^\To buy my little property will cost$
+you half a million English pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know Solomon Brothers, the financiers of London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know them very well,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright steadily. He had good reason$
+to know Solomon Brothers, who had taken a large block of shares in his$
+new syndicate.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just had a telegram from Solomon Brothers,‚M-^@M-^] said Se√±or Brigot,$
+speaking slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and they ask me to give them the date when my property$
+was transferred to your syndicate. They tell me it is included in your$
+properties which you have floated. You know best, Mr. Cartwright,$
+whether my little mine is worth half a million English pounds to$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tespecially if I put a date agreeable to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blackmail, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright between his teeth, and without a word$
+left the room.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VII$
+$
+$
+HE went straight back to his flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army, and$
+the girl could see by his face that something had happened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might pack my bag, will you?‚M-^@M-^] he said almost brusquely. ‚M-^@M-^\I have a$
+letter or two to write. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to London. Important business has$
+arisen, and I may be gone some time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Wisely she asked no questions, but carried out his instructions. When$
+she came back from the room with a little gripsack packed, he was$
+blotting the envelope of the last letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Post these after I have gone,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I come down to the station and see you off?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The less you and I are seen together, the better, I think,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+with a faint smile.$
+$
+He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a cash-box. From this he$
+extracted a thick wad of notes, and, counting them rapidly, he tossed a$
+respectable bundle into her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may want this,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you have a regular income, but$
+you must keep in touch with the Lyonnais. For the moment I should advise$
+you to go to‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The looked at the ceiling for inspiration‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to Nice or$
+Monte Carlo. Keep away from the tables,‚M-^@M-^] he added humorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But‚M-^@M-^Tbut,‚M-^@M-^] said the bewildered girl, ‚M-^@M-^\for how long will you be gone?$
+Can‚M-^@M-^Yt I come with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is impossible,‚M-^@M-^] he said sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\You must go to the South of$
+France, leave by to-night‚M-^@M-^Ys train. Give your address to nobody, and take$
+another name if necessary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are things very wrong?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pretty bad,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry. I may be gone for a year, even$
+more. There are plenty of things you can do, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt go back into the$
+profession yet awhile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of taking up cinema work,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might do worse than go to America‚M-^@M-^Tif I am a long time gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stuffed the remainder of the notes into his pocket, picked up his$
+bag, and with no other farewell than a curt nod, left her.$
+$
+She was only to see him once again in her life-time.$
+$
+He crossed the Channel by the night boat and came to London in the early$
+hours of the morning. He drove straight away to his hotel, had a bath$
+and shaved. His plan was fairly well formed. Everything depended upon$
+the charity which Messrs. Solomon Brothers might display towards his$
+strange lapse.$
+$
+At breakfast he read in _The Times_ that ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Justice Maxell took his$
+seat upon the Bench‚M-^@M-^] on the previous day, and that paragraph, for some$
+reason, seemed to cheer him.$
+$
+At ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock he was in the City. At half-past ten he was interviewing$
+the senior partner of Solomon Brothers, a man with an expressionless$
+face, who listened courteously to the somewhat lame excuses which$
+Cartwright offered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was a mistake of a blundering clerk,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\As$
+soon as I discovered the error, I came back to London to withdraw all$
+the money which had been subscribed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a pity you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt come back yesterday, Mr. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Solomon.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\that we have already placed this matter in$
+the hands of our solicitors. I suggest that you had better interview$
+them.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright made a further pilgrimage to the solicitors of Solomon$
+Brothers, and found them most unwilling to see him. That was an ominous$
+sign, and he went back to his office in Victoria Street conscious that a$
+crisis was at hand. At any rate, the girl was out of the way; but, what$
+was more important, she, one of the principal witnesses in so far as$
+Brigot and his property were concerned, was not available for those who$
+might bring a charge against him. She was his wife, and her lips were$
+sealed, and this consequence of his marriage was one which he had not$
+wholly overlooked when he had contracted his strange alliance.$
+$
+What a fool he had been! The property might have been transferred and in$
+his hands, if he had not antagonised a wretched little Spanish$
+theatrical manager. But, he reflected, if he had not antagonised that$
+manager, he would not have possessed the instrument for extracting the$
+transfer from the amorous Brigot.$
+$
+At the top of a heap of letters awaiting him was one written in a firm$
+boyish hand, and Cartwright made a little grimace, as though for the$
+first time recognising his responsibility.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson; my lad, you will have to take a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and pushed the letter aside unopened.$
+$
+He lunched at his club, sent a brief letter to Maxell, and returned to$
+his office at two in the afternoon. His clerk told him that a man was$
+waiting for him in the inner office. Cartwright hesitated with his hand$
+on the door; then, setting his teeth, he stepped in.$
+$
+The stranger rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you Mr. Alfred Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is my name,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am Inspector Guilbury, of the City Police,‚M-^@M-^] said the stranger, ‚M-^@M-^\and I$
+shall take you into custody on charges under the Companies Act, and a$
+further charge of conspiracy to defraud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go ahead,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+All the week preceding the trial, Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys heart was filled with$
+warm, gratitude to his erstwhile friend. He did not doubt, when his$
+solicitor told him that Mr. Justice Maxell would try his case, that$
+Maxell had gone a long way out of his way to get himself appointed the$
+Old Bailey judge. How like Maxell it was‚M-^@M-^Tthat queer, solemn stick‚M-^@M-^Tand$
+how loyal!$
+$
+Cartwright had a feeling for Maxell which he had never had before. At$
+first he had feared the embarrassment which might be Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys at having$
+to try a case in which an old friend was implicated, and had even hoped$
+that the new judge would have nothing to do with the trial. He did not$
+despair of Maxell pulling strings on his behalf, and he realised that$
+much could be done by judicious lobbying.$
+$
+The charge against him was a grave one. He had not realised how serious$
+it was until he had seen that respectful array of counsel in the Lord$
+Mayor‚M-^@M-^Ys Court, and had heard his misdemeanours reduced to cold legal$
+phraseology. But he did not wholly despair. Brigot had been coming to$
+London to give evidence, and on his journey there had occurred an$
+incident which suggested to the accused man that Providence was fighting$
+on his side. The Spaniard had had a stroke in the train to Calais, and$
+the doctors reported that he might not recover. Not that Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+evidence was indispensable. There was, apparently, a letter and two$
+telegrams in existence, in the course of which Brigot denied that he had$
+ever parted with his property; and the onus lay upon Cartwright to prove$
+that he had acted in a _bona fide_ manner‚M-^@M-^Tthat was impossible of proof,$
+and nobody knew this better than Cartwright.$
+$
+And ever his mind reverted to the singular act of generosity on the part$
+of his old friend. He did not doubt for one moment that Maxell had$
+‚M-^@M-^\worked‚M-^@M-^] the case so that it fell to him to try it.$
+$
+It was a bright morning in May when he came up the steps of the Old$
+Bailey and took his place in the dock. Almost immediately after, the$
+Judge and the Sheriff entered from the door behind the plain oaken$
+bench. How well the judicial robes became Maxell, thought Cartwright. He$
+bowed slightly and received as slight a bow in reply. Maxell was looking$
+pale. His face was drawn, and there was resolution in his speech and in$
+his eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before this case proceeds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I wish to direct attention to a$
+statement in one of the newspapers this morning, that I was associated$
+with the accused in business, and that I am in some way involved,$
+directly or indirectly, in the company promotion‚M-^@M-^Teither as a$
+shareholder or an indirect promoter‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the subject of the present$
+charge. I wish to utter an emphatic denial to that statement.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He spoke clearly and slowly and looked the prisoner straight in the eye,$
+and Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can only endorse your lordship‚M-^@M-^Ys statement,‚M-^@M-^] he said emphatically.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your lordship has never had any dealings with me or any business$
+transactions whatsoever.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a minor sensation which provided a headline for the evening$
+newspapers. The case proceeded. It was not particularly involved and the$
+witnesses were few but vital. There were those business men who had$
+subscribed or promised to subscribe to the syndicate. There was Mr.$
+Solomon, who could give an account of his dealings with the prisoner.$
+But, most damning of all, was a sworn statement made by Brigot before an$
+English solicitor, a Commissioner of Oaths. And it was such a statement$
+which only documentary proof, produced by the accused man, could refute.$
+$
+Cartwright listened to the evidence untroubled of mind. He knew that his$
+counsel‚M-^@M-^Ys speech, delivered with such force, was little less than an$
+admission of guilt and a plea for mercy. The last word would be with the$
+judge. A verdict of ‚M-^@M-^\guilty‚M-^@M-^] there must necessarily be. But he thought$
+that, when later his counsel pleaded for a minimum sentence, he saw a$
+responsive look in the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+The stigma of imprisonment did not greatly distress Cartwright. He had$
+lived on the narrow border-line of illegalities too long; he had weighed$
+chances and penalties too nicely to bother about such ephemeral things$
+as ‚M-^@M-^\honour.‚M-^@M-^] His system of finance was reviewed, and certain minor$
+charges arising out of the manipulation of funds were gone into. It was$
+late in the evening when the Judge began his summing up.$
+$
+It was a fair, if a conventional address he delivered to the jury.$
+Obviously, thought Cartwright, he could do nothing less than call$
+attention to the serious nature of the charge, the interests involved,$
+the betrayal of shareholders, and the like. On the whole, the summing up$
+did not diminish the comforting sense that the worst that lay before him$
+was a few months‚M-^@M-^Y imprisonment and then a start in another land under$
+another name. He never doubted his ability to make money. The summing up$
+was ended, and the jury retired. They were gone twenty minutes, and when$
+they came back it was a foregone conclusion what their verdict would be.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Guilty,‚M-^@M-^] was the reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And is that the verdict of you all?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Justice Maxell was examining his notes, and presently he closed the$
+little book which he was consulting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The charge against Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is one of the most$
+serious which could be brought against a business man. The jury have$
+returned a verdict of guilty, and I must say that I concur in that$
+verdict. I am here in my place‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This voice shook a little‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to$
+administer and maintain the laws of England. I must do all that in me is$
+possible to preserve the purity of commercial life and the condition of$
+English commercial honesty.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright waited for that ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tit did not come.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In view of the seriousness of the frauds and irregularities which the$
+accused has committed, with a cynical disregard for the happiness or$
+fortune of those people whose interests should have been his own, I$
+cannot do less than pass a sentence which will serve as an example to$
+all wrongdoers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped and gripped the edge of the dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You, Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, and again looked him straight in$
+the eye, ‚M-^@M-^\will be kept in penal servitude for twenty years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright swallowed something. Then he leaned across the edge of the$
+dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You swine!‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily, and then the warders dragged him away.$
+$
+Two days later there was a new sensation. The newspapers announced that$
+Mr. Justice Maxell had been compelled, on account of ill-health, to$
+resign from the Bench, and that His Majesty had been pleased to confer a$
+baronetcy of the United Kingdom upon the ex-Judge.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VIII$
+$
+$
+SOME nine years after the events detailed in the last chapter, a$
+fairly clever young actress who had drifted into the cinematograph$
+business, faced one of the many disappointments which had made up her$
+life. In many ways the disappointment was more bitter than any she had$
+previously experienced, because she had banked so heavily upon success.$
+$
+If there was any satisfaction to be had out of the new tragedy it was to$
+be found in the fact that the fault was not entirely hers. An impartial$
+critic might, indeed, absolve her from all responsibility.$
+$
+In this particular instance she regarded herself in the light of a$
+martyr to indifferent literature‚M-^@M-^Tnot without reason.$
+$
+When the Westminster Art Film Company was tottering on its last legs,$
+Mr. Willie Ellsberger, chairman and chief victim, decided on one big$
+throw for fortune. The play decided upon does not matter, because it was$
+written by Willie himself, with the assistance of his advertising man,$
+but it contained all the stunts that had ever got by in all the photo$
+plays that had ever been produced, and in and out of every breathless$
+situation flashed Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, the most amazing, the most charming,$
+the most romantic, the highest salaried artiste that filmland had ever$
+known.$
+$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had come to London from Honolulu, after she had inherited$
+her father‚M-^@M-^Ys considerable fortune. She came, a curious visitor, to the$
+studios, merely as a spectator, and had laughingly refused Mr.$
+Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys first offer, that gentleman having been attracted by her$
+perfect face and the grace of her movements; but at last, after$
+extraordinary persuasion, she had agreed to star in that stupendous$
+production, ‚M-^@M-^\The Soul of Babylon,‚M-^@M-^] for a fee of ¬£25,000, which was to be$
+distributed amongst certain Honolulu charities in which she was$
+interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] she told a newspaper man, ‚M-^@M-^\this is to be my first and my last$
+film. I enjoy the work very much, but naturally it takes up a great deal$
+of my time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you returning to Honolulu?‚M-^@M-^] asked our representative.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] replied Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, ‚M-^@M-^\I am going on to Paris. My agent has bought$
+me the Duc de Montpelier‚M-^@M-^Ys house in the Avenue d‚M-^@M-^YEtoile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A week after the picture was finished, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady waited on the$
+chairman by appointment.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] said that gentleman, leaning back in his chair, and$
+smiling unhappily, ‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a flivver!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We ran it off for the big renter from the North, and he says it is$
+about as bad as it can be, and that all the good in it is so obviously$
+stolen, that he dare not risk the injunction which would follow the$
+first exhibition. Did Simmonds pay you your last week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, Mr. Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Ellsberger shrugged.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sets me back another twenty pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said and reached for his$
+cheque-book. ‚M-^@M-^\It is tough on you, Sadie, but it‚M-^@M-^Ys tougher on us. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+so sure that it is so tough on you, though. I spent a fortune$
+advertising you. There isn‚M-^@M-^Yt anybody in this country who hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt heard of$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and,‚M-^@M-^] he added grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yve more publicity than I hope$
+I shall get when this business goes into the hands of the Official$
+Receiver.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So there‚M-^@M-^Ys no more work?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl after a pause.$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys hands said: ‚M-^@M-^\What can I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You ought not to have any difficulty in getting a shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\with$
+your figure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Especially when the figure‚M-^@M-^Ys twenty pounds a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+unsmilingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I was a fool ever to leave Paris. I was doing well there$
+and I wish I‚M-^@M-^Yd never heard of the cinema business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Still young and pretty and slim, with a straight nose and a straighter$
+mouth, she had no appeal for Mr. Ellsberger, who in matters of business$
+had an unsympathetic nature.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you go back to Paris?‚M-^@M-^] he said, speaking very deliberately$
+and looking out of the window. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps that affair has blown over by$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What affair?‚M-^@M-^] she asked sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve friends in Paris,‚M-^@M-^] said the chairman, ‚M-^@M-^\good, bright boys who go$
+around a lot, and they know most of what‚M-^@M-^Ys going on in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, biting her lips thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Reggie van Rhyn‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble you heard about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what happened, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll never believe in a thousand years$
+that I stabbed him,‚M-^@M-^] she said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been too much of$
+a lady for that sort of thing‚M-^@M-^TI was educated at a convent.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger yawned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take that to Curtis, will you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\If he can get any free$
+publicity for you, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yll be glad. Now take my advice‚M-^@M-^Tstay on. I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+put Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady way up amongst the well-known products of Movieland,$
+and you‚M-^@M-^Yll be a fool if you quit just when the public is getting$
+interested in you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym in bad, but that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt affect you, Sadie, and$
+there ain‚M-^@M-^Yt a producer in England who wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt jump at you and give you$
+twice the salary I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She stood up, undecided. Ellsberger was growing weary of the interview.$
+He made a great show of pulling out notepaper and rang the bell for his$
+stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The publicity‚M-^@M-^Ys fine,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yve felt good about the$
+work. Why the letters that I‚M-^@M-^Yve had from people asking for my autograph$
+and pictures of my Honolulu estate‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe smiled a little$
+frostily‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\people in society, too. Why, a titled man who wrote to me$
+from Bournemouth, Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger was interested, indeed, he was fascinated. He waved away$
+his stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre sure it was Maxell? Sir John$
+Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys class there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And there‚M-^@M-^Ys money, too,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+get in touch with him, Sadie? A fellow like that would think nothing of$
+putting ten thousand into a picture if he was interested in a girl. If$
+you happen to be the girl, Sadie, there‚M-^@M-^Yll be a thousand pound contract$
+for you right away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Her straight lips were a trifle hard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you want is an angel, and the Judge is the best kind of angel you$
+could wish for.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has he got money?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] said the hands of Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\What a ridiculous question to$
+ask!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] he scoffed. ‚M-^@M-^\Money to burn. Do you mean to say you‚M-^@M-^Yve never$
+heard of Sir John Maxell, never heard of the man who sent his best$
+friend to gaol for twenty years? Why, it was the biggest sensation of$
+the year!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sadie was not very interested in history, but momentarily, by virtue of$
+the very warm and well punctuated letter which reposed in her bag, she$
+was interested in Sir John.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is he married?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl naturally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is not married,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger emphatically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Any children?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no children, but he has a niece‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got some legal$
+responsibility as regards her; I remember seeing it in the newspapers,$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys her guardian or something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger looked at the girl with a speculative eye.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you his letter?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded and produced the epistle.$
+$
+It was polite but warm. It had some reference to her ‚M-^@M-^\gracious talent,‚M-^@M-^]$
+to her ‚M-^@M-^\unexampled beauty‚M-^@M-^] which had ‚M-^@M-^\brought pleasure to one who was no$
+longer influenced by the commonplace,‚M-^@M-^] and it finished up by expressing$
+the hope that they two would meet in the early future, and that before$
+leaving for Paris she would honour him by being his guest for a few$
+days.$
+$
+Ellsberger handed the letter back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Write him,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and, Sadie, consider yourself engaged for another$
+week‚M-^@M-^Twrite to him in my time. He‚M-^@M-^Ys fallen for all that Press stuff, and$
+maybe, if he‚M-^@M-^Ys got that passionate admiration for your genius$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll‚M-^@M-^Tsay, you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to stay in the picture business and finish by$
+marrying that kind of trouble, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pointed through the wide windows to a youth who was coming across$
+from the studio to the office, swinging a cane vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Observe the lavender socks and the wrist watch,‚M-^@M-^] he chuckled. ‚M-^@M-^\But$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt make any mistake about Timothy Anderson. He‚M-^@M-^Ys the toughest amateur$
+at his weight in this or any other state and a good boy, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+kind of fellow that women like you marry‚M-^@M-^Tget acquainted with the$
+Judge.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+With only a preliminary knock, which he did not wait to hear answered,$
+the young man had swung through the door, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do, Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I saw your picture‚M-^@M-^Tfine! Good acting,$
+but a perfectly rotten play. I suppose you wrote it, Ellsberger?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wrote it,‚M-^@M-^] admitted that gentleman gloomily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It bears the impression of your genius, old bird.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson shook his head reproachfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It only wanted you as the leading man, and it would have been dead$
+before we put the titles in,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger with a grin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of the movies for good,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy Anderson, sitting himself$
+on a table. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a demoralising occupation‚M-^@M-^Twhich reminds me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped from the table, thrust his hand into his pocket, and$
+producing a roll of notes:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I owe you twenty-five pounds, Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Thank you very$
+much. You saved me from ruin and starvation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He counted the money across, and Mr. Ellsberger was undoubtedly$
+surprised and made no attempt to conceal the fact. So surprised was he$
+that he could be jocose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Fixed a big contract with Mary Pickford?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\N-no,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I struck a roulette game‚M-^@M-^Tand took a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Took a chance again, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\One of these days you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+take a chance and never get better of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pooh!‚M-^@M-^] said the other in derision. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you think that‚M-^@M-^Ys any new$
+experience for me? Not on your life. I went into this game with just$
+twelve pounds and my hotel bill three weeks in arrears. I was down to my$
+last half-crown, but I played it and came out with three hundred$
+pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Whose game was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Ellsberger curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tony Smail,‚M-^@M-^] and Mr. Ellsberger whistled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, that‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the toughest places in town,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a$
+wonder you came away with the money‚M-^@M-^Tand your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I took a chance,‚M-^@M-^] said the other carelessly, and swung his legs once$
+more over the edge of the desk. ‚M-^@M-^\There was some slight trouble when I$
+came out of Smail‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] he shrugged his shoulders, ‚M-^@M-^\just a little$
+horseplay.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had followed the conversation keenly. Any talk which circled$
+about finance had the effect of concentrating her attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you always take a chance?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Always,‚M-^@M-^] said the other promptly.$
+$
+This woman did not appeal to him. Timothy possessed a seventh sense$
+which he called his ‚M-^@M-^\Sorter,‚M-^@M-^] and Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady was already sorted$
+into the heap of folks who, had life been a veritable voyage, would have$
+been labelled ‚M-^@M-^\Not Wanted.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going by the next boat to New York,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\then I‚M-^@M-^Yll go to$
+California. Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll take in Kempton on my way, for a fellow I met at$
+the hotel has a horse running which can catch pigeons. Good-bye, Miss$
+O‚M-^@M-^YGrady. I wish you every kind of luck.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She watched him disappear, sensing his antagonism and responding$
+thereto. If he could judge women by intuition, she judged him by reason,$
+and she knew that here was a man whose mental attitude was one of$
+dormant hostility.$
+$
+It would be unfair to her to say that it was because she recognised the$
+clean mind and the healthy outlook and the high principles of this young$
+man that she disliked him. She was not wholly bad, because she had been$
+the victim of circumstances and had lately lived a two-thousand pound$
+life on a one-hundred pound capacity. She looked after him, biting her$
+lips as though she were solving a great problem.$
+$
+Presently she turned to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll write to Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+By a curious coincidence Timothy Anderson had the idea of approaching$
+Sir John Maxell also, though nearly a year passed before he carried his$
+idea into execution.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER IX$
+$
+$
+THE initials ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] before young Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood for$
+Timothy Alfred Cartwright, his pious but practical parent having, by$
+this combination, made a bid for the protection of the saints and the$
+patronage of Cousin Al Cartwright, reputedly a millionaire and a$
+bachelor. It was hoped in this manner that his position on earth and in$
+heaven would be equally secure.$
+$
+What Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chances are in the hereafter the reader must decide; but$
+we do know that Cousin Al Cartwright proved both a weak reed and a$
+whited sepulchre. Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys parents had departed this life two years$
+after Alfred Cartwright had disappeared from public view, leaving behind$
+him two years‚M-^@M-^Y work for a committee of Investigating Accounts.$
+$
+When his surviving parent died, the boy was at school, and if he was not$
+a prodigy of learning he was at least brilliant in parts.$
+$
+Though it was with no great regret that he left school, he was old$
+enough and shrewd enough to realise that a bowing acquaintance with the$
+differential calculus, and the ability to conjugate the verb ‚M-^@M-^\avoir‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute an equipment, sufficiently comprehensive (if you will$
+forgive these long words), to meet and defeat such enemies to human$
+progress as he was likely to meet in this cruel and unsympathetic world.$
+$
+He had a small income bequeathed by his mother in a will which was$
+almost apologetic because she left so little, and he settled himself$
+down as a boarder in the house of a schoolmaster, and took up those$
+branches of study which interested him, and set himself to forget other$
+branches of education which interested him not at all.$
+$
+Because of his ineradicable passion for challenging fate it was only$
+natural that ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] should bear a new significance, and since some$
+genius had christened him ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson the name stuck. And$
+he took chances. From every throw with fate he learnt something. He had$
+acquired some knowledge of boxing at school, and had learnt enough of$
+the art to enable him to head the school. Such was his faith in himself$
+and his persuasive eloquence that he induced Sam Murphy,$
+ex-middle-weight and proprietor of the Stag‚M-^@M-^Ys Head, Dorking, to nominate$
+and support him for a ten-rounds contest with that redoubtable$
+feather-weight, Bill Schenk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson took his chance. He also took the count in the$
+first round, and, returning to consciousness, vowed a vow‚M-^@M-^Tnot that he$
+would never again enter the ring, but that he would learn something more$
+of the game before he did. Of course, it was very disgraceful that a man$
+of his antecedents should become a professional boxer‚M-^@M-^Tfor professional$
+he became in the very act of failure‚M-^@M-^Tbut that worried him not at all.$
+$
+It is a matter of history that Bill Schenk was knocked out by Kid$
+Muldoon, and that twelve months after his initiation into the prize ring$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. Anderson‚M-^@M-^] fought twenty rounds with the Kid and got the decision on$
+points. Thereafter, the ring knew ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson no more.$
+$
+He took a chance on race-courses, backing horses that opened at tens and$
+closed at twenties. He backed horses that had never won before on the$
+assumption that they must win some time. He had sufficient money left$
+after this adventure to buy a book of form. He devoted his undoubted$
+talent to the study of other games of chance. He played cards for$
+matches with a broker‚M-^@M-^Ys clerk, who harboured secret ambitions of going$
+to Monte Carlo with a system; he purchased on the hire system$
+wonderfully cheap properties on the Isle of Thanet‚M-^@M-^Tand he worked.$
+$
+For all his fooling and experimenting, for all his gambling and his$
+chancing, Timothy never let a job of work get past him, if he could do$
+it, and when he wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt working for sordid lucre he was working for the$
+good of his soul. He went to the races with a volume of Moli√®re‚M-^@M-^Ys plays$
+under his arm, and between events he read, hereby acquiring the respect$
+of the racing fraternity as an earnest student of form.$
+$
+So he came by violent, yet to him easy, stages to Movieland‚M-^@M-^Tthat Mecca$
+which attracts all that is enterprising and romantic and restless. He$
+took a chance in a juvenile lead, but his method and his style of$
+actions were original. Producers are for ever on the look out for$
+novelty, but they put the bar up against novel styles of acting and$
+expression. Ellsberger had tried him out because he had known his$
+father, but more because he had won money over him when he had beaten$
+Kid Muldoon; but even Ellsberger was compelled to suggest that Timothy$
+put in two long years ‚M-^@M-^\atmosphering‚M-^@M-^] before he essayed an individual$
+r√¥le on the screen.$
+$
+Timothy was not certain whether his train left at ten minutes to seven$
+or at ten minutes past seven, so he arrived in time for the ten minutes$
+to seven, which was characteristic of him, because he never took a$
+chance against the inflexible systems.$
+$
+He reached New York without misadventure, but on his way westward he$
+stayed over at Nevada. He intended spending a night, but met a man with$
+a scheme for running a mail-order business on entirely new lines,$
+invested his money, and by some miracle managed to make it last a year.$
+At the end of that time the police were after his partner, and Timothy$
+was travelling eastward by easy stages.$
+$
+He came back to New York with fifty-five dollars which he had won from a$
+Westerner on the last stage of the journey. The track ran for about$
+twenty miles along the side of the road, the wager between them was a$
+very simple one; it was whether they would pass more men than women on$
+the road. The Westerner chose men and Timothy chose women. For every man$
+they saw Timothy paid a dollar, for every woman he received a dollar. In$
+the agreed hour they passed fifty-five more women than they passed men$
+and Timothy was that many dollars richer. There were never so many women$
+abroad as there were that bright afternoon, and the Westerner couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+understand it until he realised that it was Sunday‚M-^@M-^Ta fact which Timothy$
+had grasped before he had made his wager.$
+$
+Two months later he was back in London. How he got back he never$
+explained. He stayed in London only long enough to fit himself up with a$
+new kit before he presented himself at a solid mansion in Branksome$
+Park, Bournemouth. Years and years before, Sir John Maxell had written$
+to him, asking him to call upon him for any help he might require, and$
+promising to assist him in whatever difficulties he might find himself.$
+Timothy associated the offer with the death of his father‚M-^@M-^Tmaybe they$
+were friends.$
+$
+He was shown into the sunny drawing-room bright with flowers, and he$
+looked round approvingly. He had lived in other people‚M-^@M-^Ys houses all his$
+life‚M-^@M-^Tschools, boarding-houses, hotels and the like‚M-^@M-^Tand an atmosphere$
+of home came to him like the forgotten fragrance of a garden he had$
+known.$
+$
+The servant came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will see you in ten minutes, sir, but you must not keep him$
+long, because he has to go out to meet Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in surprise, ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know he was$
+married.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant smiled and said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Judge married a year ago, sir. It was in all the newspapers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt read all the newspapers,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt sufficient$
+time. Who was the lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man looked round, as if fearing to be overheard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John married the cinema lady, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and the$
+hostility in his tone was unmistakable.$
+$
+Timothy gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, that beats the band! Why, I knew that$
+da‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T, that lady in London!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant inclined his head sideways.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Indeed, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and it was evident that he did not regard$
+Timothy as being any fitter for human association by reason of his$
+confession.$
+$
+A distant bell buzzed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John is ready, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I hope you will not mention the fact$
+that I spoke of madam?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy winked, and was readmitted to the confidence of the democracy.$
+$
+Sir John Maxell was standing up behind his writing table, a fine, big$
+man with his grey hair neatly brushed back from his forehead and his$
+blue eyes magnified behind rimless glasses.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, coming round the table with slow steps.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely this is not the little Timothy I heard so much about years and$
+years ago!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is I, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I should never have known you. Sit down, my$
+boy. You smoke, of course‚M-^@M-^Teverybody smokes nowadays, but it seems$
+strange that a boy I knew in short breeches should have acquired the$
+habit. I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said, as Timothy lit his cigar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing to my discredit, I hope, sir?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he repeated diplomatically, ‚M-^@M-^\let it go at$
+that. Now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve come here because, five years ago, on the$
+twenty-third of December to be correct, I wrote to you, offering to give$
+you any help that lay in my power.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I won‚M-^@M-^Yt swear to the date,‚M-^@M-^] said Tim.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But I will,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the other. ‚M-^@M-^\I never forget a date, I never forget a$
+letter, I never forget the exact wording of that letter. My memory is an$
+amazing gift. Now just tell me what I can do for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I have had a pretty bad time in America. I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+running in a team with a crook and I‚M-^@M-^Yve had to pay out every cent I had$
+in the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded slowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then it is money you want,‚M-^@M-^] he said, without enthusiasm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly money, sir, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to try to start in London and I$
+thought, maybe, you might give me a letter of introduction to somebody.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, brightening up, ‚M-^@M-^\I think I can do that for you.$
+What did you think of doing in London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of getting some sort of secretarial job,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Not that$
+I know much about it!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John pinched his lower lip.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know a man who may help you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We were in the House of$
+Commons together and he would give you a place in one of his offices,$
+but unfortunately for you he has made a great deal of money and spends$
+most of his time at Newmarket.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds good to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance$
+there. Perhaps he‚M-^@M-^Yd try me out in that office?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Judge permitted himself to smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In Newmarket,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\our friend does very little more, I fear, than$
+waste his time and money on the race-course. He has half a dozen$
+horses‚M-^@M-^TI had a letter from him this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked back to his table, searched in the litter, and presently$
+amongst the papers pulled out a letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As a matter of fact, I had some business with him and I wrote to him$
+for information. The only thing he tells me is‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthis with a gesture of$
+despair‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\that Skyball and Polly Chaw‚M-^@M-^Tthose are the names of$
+race-horses, I presume‚M-^@M-^Twill win the two big handicaps next week and$
+that he has a flyer named Swift Kate that can beat anything‚M-^@M-^TI am$
+quoting his words‚M-^@M-^Ton legs over six furlongs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up over his glasses at Timothy, and on that young man‚M-^@M-^Ys face$
+was a seraphic smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds real nice to me,‚M-^@M-^] glowed Timothy.$
+$
+Remembering the injunctions of the servant, he was taking his adieu,$
+when his host asked, in a lower voice than that in which the$
+conversation had been carried on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you have not heard from your cousin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at him in astonishment. Had Sir John asked after the$
+Grand Llama of Tibet he would have been as well prepared to answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, no, sir‚M-^@M-^Tno‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tis he alive?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John Maxell looked at him sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alive? Of course. I thought you might have heard from him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\he disappeared. I only met him once when I was a$
+kid. Was he a friend‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tan acquaintance of yours?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John was drumming his fingers on the desk and his mind was far away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes and no,‚M-^@M-^] he said shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\I knew him, and at one time I was$
+friendly with him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly he glanced at his watch, and a look of consternation came to$
+his face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Great heavens!‚M-^@M-^] he cried. ‚M-^@M-^\I promised to meet my wife a quarter of an$
+hour ago. Good-bye! Good-bye!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He hand-shook Timothy from the room and the young man had to find his$
+way downstairs without guidance, because the manservant was at that$
+moment heavily engaged.$
+$
+From the floor below came a shrill, unpleasant sound, and Timothy$
+descended to find himself in the midst of a domestic crisis. There were$
+two ladies in the hall‚M-^@M-^Tone a mere silent, contained spectator, the$
+other the principal actress. He recognised her at once, but she did not$
+see him, because her attention was directed to the red-faced servant.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When I ring you on the ‚M-^@M-^Yphone, I expect to be answered,‚M-^@M-^] she was$
+saying. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to do except to sit round and keep your ears$
+open, you big, lazy devil!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But, my lady, I‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt answer me,‚M-^@M-^] she stormed. ‚M-^@M-^\If you think I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing better to do$
+than to sit at a ‚M-^@M-^Yphone waiting till you wake up, why, you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+mistaken‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys all. And if Sir John doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt fire you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about Sir John firing me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man with a sudden$
+change of manner. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve just had about as much of you as I can stand.$
+You keep your bossing for the movies, Lady Maxell. You‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to$
+try any of that stuff with me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was incapable of further speech, nor was there any necessity for it$
+since the man turned on his heels and disappeared into that mysterious$
+region which lies at the back of every entrance hall. Then for the first$
+time she saw Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you do, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She glared round at the interrupter, and for a moment he thought she$
+intended venting her anger on him. She was still frowning when he took$
+her limp hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre the Anderson boy, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked a little ungraciously.$
+$
+The old sense of antagonism was revived and intensified in him at the$
+touch of her hand. She was unchanged, looking, if anything, more pretty$
+than when he had seen her last, but the hardness at her mouth was$
+accentuated, and she had taken on an indefinable air of superiority$
+which differed very little from sheer insolence.$
+$
+A gold-rimmed lorgnette came up to survey him, and he was nettled‚M-^@M-^Tonly$
+women had the power to annoy him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt changed a bit,‚M-^@M-^] he bantered. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry your eyesight is$
+not so good as it was. Studio life is pretty tough on the eyes, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She closed her lorgnette with a snap, and turned to the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better see what Sir John is doing,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Ask him what he$
+thinks I am, that I should wait in the hall like a tramp.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was then that the girl came out of the shadow and Timothy saw her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is the ward or niece,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and sighed, for never$
+had he seen a human creature who so satisfied his eye. There is a beauty$
+which is neither statuesque nor cold, nor to be confounded with$
+prettiness. It is a beauty which depends upon no regularity of feature$
+or of colour, but which has its reason in its contradictions.$
+$
+The smiling Madonna whom Leonardo drew had such contradictory quality as$
+this girl possessed. For she was ninety per cent. child, and carried in$
+her face all the bubbling joy of youth. Yet she impressed Timothy as$
+being strange and unnatural. Her meekness, her ready obedience to carry$
+out the woman‚M-^@M-^Ys instruction, the very dignity of her departure‚M-^@M-^Tthese$
+things did not fit with the character he read in her face. Had she$
+turned curtly to this insolent woman and told her to carry her message$
+herself, or had she flown up the stairs calling for Sir John as she$
+went, these things would have been natural.$
+$
+Lady Maxell turned upon him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And see here, Mr. What‚M-^@M-^Ys-your-name, if you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of Sir John,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yll forget that I was ever in a studio. There are enough stories$
+about me in Bournemouth without your adding to the collection.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mother‚M-^@M-^Ys little thoroughbred!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy admiringly; ‚M-^@M-^\spoken like a$
+true little lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+In some respects he was wholly undisciplined, and had never learnt the$
+necessity of refraining from answering back. And the woman irritated$
+him, and irritation was a novel sensation.$
+$
+Her face was dark with rage, but it was upon Sir John, descending in$
+haste to meet his offended wife, that she turned the full batteries of$
+her anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know the time, of course. Your watch has stopped. It is hard$
+enough for me to keep my end up without you helping to make me look$
+foolish!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] protested Maxell in a flurry, ‚M-^@M-^\I assure you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can spend your time with this sort of trash,‚M-^@M-^] she indicated$
+Timothy, and Timothy bowed, ‚M-^@M-^\but you keep me waiting like a tailor‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+model at Sotheby‚M-^@M-^Ys, of all people in the world, when you know well$
+enough‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] pleaded the lawyer wearily, ‚M-^@M-^\my watch has certainly$
+stopped‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! You make me tired. What are you doing with this fellow? Do you$
+think I want reminding of movie days? Everybody knows this fellow‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+cheap gambler, who‚M-^@M-^Ys been fired out of every studio in England. You$
+allow your servants to insult me‚M-^@M-^Tand now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve brought this$
+prize-fighter to keep me in my place,‚M-^@M-^] and she pointed scornfully at the$
+amused Timothy.$
+$
+Half-way downstairs the girl stood watching the scene in silence, and it$
+was only when he became conscious of her presence that Timothy began to$
+feel a little uncomfortable.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, good-bye, Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry I intruded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\John, this man has insulted me! I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know$
+what he‚M-^@M-^Ys come for, but I suppose he wants something. He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of those$
+shifty fellows that hang around studios begging for money to bet with.$
+If you raise a hand to help him, why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I assure you,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John in his most pompous manner, ‚M-^@M-^\that this$
+young man has asked for nothing more than a letter of introduction. I$
+have a duty‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop!‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve a duty to me, too. Hold fast to your$
+money. Likely as not, you‚M-^@M-^Yll do neither with ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson$
+floating around.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was not her words, neither the contempt in her voice nor the insult$
+which stung him. The man who went twenty rounds with Kid Muldoon had$
+learnt to control his temper, but there was a new factor present‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+factor who wore a plain grey dress, and had two big, black eyes which$
+were now solemnly surveying him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is pretty difficult to give the lie to any$
+woman, but I tell you that what you say now is utterly false. I had no$
+intention when I came to Bournemouth of asking for anything that would$
+cost Sir John a penny. As to my past, I suppose it has been a little$
+eccentric, but it is clean, Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He meant no more than he said. He had no knowledge of Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+antecedents, or he might not have emphasised the purity of his own. But$
+the woman went back as though she had been whipped, and Timothy had a$
+momentary vision of a charging fury, before she flung herself upon him,$
+tearing at his face, shrieking aloud in her rage. . .$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He took off his hat and fanned himself. It was the first time he had$
+ever run away from trouble, but now he had almost flown. Those favoured$
+people who were in sight of Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys handsome villa, saw the$
+door swung open and a young man taking the front path in four strides$
+and the gate in another before he sped like the wind along the street.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy again.$
+$
+He went the longest way back to his hotel, to find that a telephone$
+message had been received from Sir John. It was short and to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt come again.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy read the slip and chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it likely?‚M-^@M-^] he asked the page who brought the message.$
+$
+Then he remembered the girl in grey, with the dark eyes, and he fingered$
+his smooth chin thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is worth while taking a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and$
+decided that, for the moment, it was not.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER X$
+$
+$
+LADY MAXELL yawned and put down the magazine she was reading. She$
+looked at her watch. It was ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. At such an hour Paris would be$
+beginning to wake up. The best people would still be in the midst of$
+their dinner, and Marie de Montdidier (born Hopkins) would be putting$
+the final dabs of powder on her nose in her dressing-room at the Folies$
+Berg√®res before making her first and her final appearance.$
+$
+The boulevards would be bright with light, and there would be lines of$
+twinkling autos in the Bois for the late diners at the Aromonville. She$
+looked across at the girl sitting under a big lamp in a window recess, a$
+book on her knees, but her mind and eyes elsewhere.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and the girl, with a start, woke from her reverie.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want me, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the matter with Sir John? You know him better than I do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know, Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt call me ‚M-^@M-^XLady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you to call me Sadie if you want to.‚M-^@M-^] There was a$
+silence. ‚M-^@M-^\Evidently you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want,‚M-^@M-^] snapped the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre what I$
+call a fine, sociable family. You seem to get your manners from your new$
+friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl went red.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My new friend?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Lady Maxell turned her back to her with$
+some resolution and resumed for a moment the reading of her magazine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt mind if you find any pleasure in talking to that kind of$
+insect,‚M-^@M-^] she said, putting the periodical down again. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, the world‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+full of those do-nothing boys. I suppose he knows there‚M-^@M-^Ys money coming$
+to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Very little, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little‚M-^@M-^Ys a lot to a man like that,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+think I am prejudiced because I was‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tannoyed the other day. That is$
+temperament.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the girl smiled, but it was a different kind of smile, and Lady$
+Maxell observed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can marry him as far as I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\These sneaking$
+meetings are not exactly complimentary to Sir John, that‚M-^@M-^Ys all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl closed her book, walked across to the shelf and put it away$
+before she spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yre speaking of Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I have met$
+him, but there has been nothing furtive in the meetings. He stopped me$
+in the park and apologised for having been responsible for the$
+scene‚M-^@M-^Tfor your temperament, you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked up sharply, but the girl met her eyes without$
+wavering.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt trying to be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] complained the older woman.$
+‚M-^@M-^\One never knows how deep you are. But I can tell you this, that sarcasm$
+is wasted on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sure of that,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked again, but apparently the girl was innocent of$
+offensive design.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say I met Mr. Anderson. He was very polite and very nice. Then I met$
+him again‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, I have met him several times,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\So far from his being a do-nothing, Lady Maxell, I think$
+you are doing him an injustice. He is working at the Parade Drug Store.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He will make a fine match for you,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will just$
+love having a shop-walker in the family!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+That ended the conversation for both of them, and they sat reading for a$
+quarter of an hour before Lady Maxell threw her magazine on the floor$
+and got up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John had a telegram yesterday that worried him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you$
+know what it was about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Honestly I do not know, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you ask$
+him yourself?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because he would tell me a lie,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman coolly, and the girl$
+winced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He brought all his money and securities from the Dawlish and County$
+Bank to-day and put them in his safe and he had the chief constable with$
+him for half an hour this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was news to the girl, and she was interested in spite of herself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to be frank with$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tfrankness pays sometimes. They called my marriage a romance of the$
+screen. Every newspaper said as much and I suppose that is true. But the$
+most romantic part of the marriage was my estate in Honolulu, my big$
+house in Paris and my bank balance. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys publicity man put all$
+that stuff about, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea that Sir John was highly disappointed$
+when he found he‚M-^@M-^Yd married me for myself alone. That‚M-^@M-^Ys how it strikes$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was a marriage which had shocked Society and had upset the smooth$
+current of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys life, placed in an entirely new light.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you very rich?‚M-^@M-^] she asked slowly, and Sadie laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rich! There was a tram fare between me and the workhouse the day I$
+married Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt blame him for being disappointed.$
+Lots of these cinema stars are worth millions‚M-^@M-^TI wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt one of them. I$
+married because I thought I was going to have a good time‚M-^@M-^Tlots of money$
+and plenty of travel‚M-^@M-^Tand I chose with my eyes shut.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was silent. For once Sadie Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys complaint had$
+justification. Sir John Maxell was not a spending man. He lived well,$
+but never outside the circle of necessity.$
+$
+The girl was about to speak, when there came a dramatic interruption.$
+$
+There was a ‚M-^@M-^\whang!‚M-^@M-^] a splintering of glass and something thudded$
+against the wall. Lady Maxell stood up as white as death.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was that?‚M-^@M-^] she gasped.$
+$
+The girl was pale, but she did not lose her nerve.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Somebody fired a shot. Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled aside the curtain. ‚M-^@M-^\The bullet went through the window.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Keep away from the window, you fool!‚M-^@M-^] screamed the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Turn out the$
+light! Ring the bell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mary moved across the room and turned the switch. They waited in$
+silence, but no other shot was fired. Perhaps it was an accident.$
+Somebody had been firing at a target. . . .$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go and tell my husband!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie. ‚M-^@M-^\Quickly!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl passed through the lighted hall upstairs and knocked at Sir$
+John‚M-^@M-^Ys door. There was no answer. She tried the door, but found it$
+locked. This was not unusual. He had a separate entrance to his study,$
+communicating by a balcony and a flight of stairs with the garden. A$
+wild fear seized her. Possibly Sir John had been in the garden when the$
+shot was fired; it may have been intended for him. She knocked again$
+louder, and this time she heard his step and the door was opened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you knock before?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\I was writing‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Then he saw her face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+The girl told him, and he made his way downstairs slowly, as was his$
+wont. He entered the drawing-room, switched on the lights, and without a$
+glance at his wife walked to the window and examined the shattered pane.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I imagined I heard a noise, but thought somebody had dropped something.$
+When did this happen? Just before you came up?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+Maxell looked from one to the other. His wife was almost speechless with$
+terror, and Mary Maxell alone was calm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has come already,‚M-^@M-^] he said musingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I did not think that this$
+would happen so soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked down to the hall where the telephone hung and rang through to$
+the police station, and the girl heard all he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is Sir John Maxell speaking. A shot has just been fired through$
+my window. No, not at me‚M-^@M-^TI was in my study. Apparently a rifle shot.$
+Yes, I was right‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Presently he came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The police will be here in a few moments to make a search of the$
+grounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I doubt whether they will catch the miscreant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it possible that it was an accident?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Accident?‚M-^@M-^] He smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly. ‚M-^@M-^\That kind of$
+accident is liable to happen again. You had better come up to my study,$
+both of you, till the police arrive,‚M-^@M-^] he said and led the way up the$
+stairs.$
+$
+He did not attempt to support his wife, though her nerve was obviously$
+shaken. Possibly he did not observe this fact until they were in the$
+room, for after a glance at her face he pushed a chair forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+The study was the one room to which his wife was seldom admitted.$
+Dominated as he was by her in other matters, he was firm on this point.$
+It was perhaps something of a novelty for her‚M-^@M-^Ta novelty which will$
+still the whimper of the crying child has something of the same effect$
+upon a nervous woman.$
+$
+The door of the safe was open and the big table was piled high with$
+sealed packages. The only money she saw was a thick pad of bank-notes$
+fastened about with a paper bandage, on which something was written. On$
+this she fixed her eyes. She had never seen so much money in her life,$
+and he must have noticed the attention this display of wealth had$
+created, for he took up the money and slipped it into a large envelope.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is your money, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he beamed over his glasses at the girl.$
+$
+She was feeling the reaction of her experience now and was trembling in$
+every limb. Yet she thought she recognised in this diversion an attempt$
+on his part to soothe her, and she smiled and tried hard to respond.$
+$
+They had been daily companions since she was a mite of four, and between$
+him and his dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child there was a whole lot of understanding$
+and sympathy which other people never knew.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My money, uncle?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I realised your investments last week,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I happened to know$
+that the Corporation in which the money stood had incurred very heavy$
+losses through some error in insurance. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a great deal, but I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt afford to let you take any further risks.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was, of course, a possibility of this shot having been fired by$
+accident,‚M-^@M-^] he went on, reverting to the matter which would naturally be$
+at the back of his mind. Then he fell into thought, pacing the room in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, stopping suddenly in front of the$
+girl. ‚M-^@M-^\You told me you were going to a concert.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before she could explain why she changed her mind they heard the sound$
+of voices in the hall.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stay here,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John. ‚M-^@M-^\It is the police. I will go down and tell$
+them all there is to know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When her husband had gone, Lady Maxell rose from her chair. The table,$
+with its sealed packages, drew her like a magnet. She fingered them one$
+by one, and came at last to the envelope containing Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys patrimony.$
+This she lifted in her hands, weighing it. Then, with a deep sigh, she$
+replaced the package on the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money there,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and Mary smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a great deal, I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid. Father was comparatively poor when he$
+died.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell thoughtfully; ‚M-^@M-^\more than I have ever$
+seen since I have been in this house, believe me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She returned, as though fascinated, and lifted the envelope again and$
+peered inside.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor, was he?‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you people don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what poverty$
+is. Do you know what all this means?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held the envelope up and there was a look in her face which the girl$
+had never seen before.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means comfort, it means freedom from worry, it means that you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have to pretend and make love to men whom you loathe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had risen and was staring at her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell!‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Why‚M-^@M-^Twhy‚M-^@M-^TI never think of$
+money like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why should you?‚M-^@M-^] said the woman roughly, as she flung the package on$
+the table. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been after money in quantities like that all my life.$
+It has always been dangling in front of me and eluding me‚M-^@M-^Teluding is$
+the word, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are all those pictures?‚M-^@M-^] she changed the subject abruptly,$
+pointing to the framed photographs which covered the walls. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+photographs of India, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John was born in Morocco and lived there$
+until he went to school. He speaks Arabic like a native. Did you know$
+that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys strange. Morocco!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know it?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been there‚M-^@M-^Tonce,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\Did Sir John go$
+often?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before he married, yes,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary. ‚M-^@M-^\He had large interests there at$
+one time, I think.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John came back at that moment, and Mary noticed that his first$
+glance was at the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, they‚M-^@M-^Yve found nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\neither footprints nor the$
+empty shell. They‚M-^@M-^Yre making a search of the grounds to-morrow. Lebbitter$
+wanted to post a man to protect the house in view of the other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What other matter?‚M-^@M-^] asked his wife quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\nothing really which concerns you. Of course,$
+I would not allow the police to do that. It would make the house more$
+conspicuous than it is at present.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at the two.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now,‚M-^@M-^] he said bluntly, ‚M-^@M-^\I think you had better go off to bed. I have$
+still a lot of work to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His wife obeyed without a word, and the girl was following her, when he$
+called her back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+the best man that ever lived, but I‚M-^@M-^Yve tried to make you happy, my dear,$
+in my own way. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been as a daughter to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked up at him with shining eyes. She could not trust herself to$
+speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Things haven‚M-^@M-^Yt gone as well as they might during the past year,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I made a colossal blunder, but I made it with my eyes open. It$
+hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt been pleasant for either of us, but there‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+regretting what you cannot mend. Mary, they tell me that you‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+seeing a lot of this young man Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was annoyed to find herself going red when there was really no$
+reason for it. She need not ask who ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^] were, she could guess.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been making inquiries about that boy,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+I can tell you this, he is straight. Perhaps he has led an$
+unconventional life, but all that he told Sadie was true. He‚M-^@M-^Ys clean,$
+and, Mary, that counts for something in this world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He seemed at a loss how to proceed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anything might happen,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Although I‚M-^@M-^Ym not an old man, I$
+have enemies. . . .‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have many enemies,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Some of them are hateful, and I want to$
+tell you this, that if trouble ever comes and that boy is within$
+call‚M-^@M-^Tgo to him. I know men, good, bad and indifferent; he‚M-^@M-^Ys neither bad$
+nor indifferent. And now, good night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He kissed her on the forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You needn‚M-^@M-^Yt tell your aunt what I‚M-^@M-^Yve been talking about,‚M-^@M-^] he said at$
+parting and led her to the door, closing and locking it behind her.$
+$
+He sat down in his chair for a very long time before he made a move,$
+then he began picking up the packages and carrying them to the safe. He$
+stopped half-way through and resumed his seat in the chair, waiting for$
+the hour to pass, by which time he judged the household would be asleep.$
+$
+At midnight he took a pair of rubber boots from a locker, pulled them$
+on, and went out through the door leading to the balcony, down the$
+covered stairway to the garden. Unerringly he walked across the lawn to$
+a corner of his grounds which his gardeners had never attempted to$
+cultivate. He stopped once and groped about in the bushes for a spade$
+which he had carefully planted there a few nights before. His hand$
+touched the rotting wood of an older spade and he smiled. For six years$
+the tool had remained where he had put it the last time he had visited$
+this No-Man‚M-^@M-^Ys-Land.$
+$
+Presently he came to a little hillock and began digging. The soil was$
+soft, and he had not gone far before the spade struck wood. He cleared a$
+space two feet square and drew from the earth a small crescent of wood.$
+It was, in fact, a part of the wooden cover of a well which had long$
+since gone dry but which had been covered up by its previous owner and$
+again covered by Maxell.$
+$
+Lying at full length on the ground, he reached down through the$
+aperture, and his fingers found a big rusty nail on which was suspended$
+a length of piano wire. At the end of the wire was attached a small$
+leather bag and this he drew up and unfastened, and putting the bag on$
+one side, let the free end of the wire fall into the well.$
+$
+He replaced the wood, covered it again with earth, all the time$
+exercising care, for, small as the aperture was, it was big enough for$
+even a man of his size to slip through.$
+$
+A cloaked figure which stood in the shadow of the bushes watching him,$
+which had followed him as noiselessly across the lawn, saw him lift the$
+bag and take it back to the house and disappear through the covered$
+stairway. So still a night it was, that the watcher could hear the click$
+of the lower door as Sir John locked it, and the soft pad of his feet as$
+they mounted the stairs.$

+$
+$
+MR. GOLDBERG, the manager and proprietor of the Parade Drug Store, was$
+a man who possessed neither a sense of imagination nor the spirit of$
+romance. He sent peremptorily for Timothy, and Timothy came with a$
+feeling that all was not well.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said Goldberg in his best magisterial manner, ‚M-^@M-^\I took$
+you into my shop because I was short of a man and because I understood$
+that you had had some business experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business experience,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy carefully, ‚M-^@M-^\of a kind.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I gave you particular instructions,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\on$
+one very vital point. We carry a full line of all the best proprietorial$
+medicines, and our customers can always get them upon application. Each$
+of those medicines we duplicate, as you know, providing the same$
+constituents and charging some sixpence to a shilling less‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, we$
+are out to save the public from being robbed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understand you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I don‚M-^@M-^Yt see much difference$
+between robbing the public and robbing the patent medicine proprietors,$
+and all that just-as-good stuff never did impress me, anyway. It stands$
+to reason,‚M-^@M-^] he said, leaning over the desk and speaking with the$
+earnestness of a crusader, ‚M-^@M-^\that the advertised article must be more$
+even in quality and it must be good all round. You can‚M-^@M-^Yt advertise a bad$
+article and get away with it, except on the first sale, and that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+pay the advertiser. The goods sell the goods, and the advertisement is$
+only to make you take the first lick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I do not want a lecture on advertising or on commercial morality,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Mr. Goldberg with ominous calm. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely want to tell you that you were$
+overheard by my chief assistant telling a customer not to ‚M-^@M-^Xtake a$
+chance‚M-^@M-^Y on one of my own pills.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys right,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, nodding his head vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Guilty, my$
+lord. What about it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have had a further complaint,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg, consulting with$
+elaborate ceremony a little notebook. ‚M-^@M-^\I understand that you have$
+initiated the awful practice of offering to toss customers for their$
+change. People have written me strong letters of complaint about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because they lost,‚M-^@M-^] said the indignant Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\what‚M-^@M-^Ys wrong about$
+that, anyway, Mr. Goldberg? I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pocket the money, and I win twice$
+out of every three times. If a fellow likes to take a chance as to$
+whether he gets sixpence or we get a shilling, why worry?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The outraged Mr. Goldberg brindled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sort of thing may be all right at a country fair or even in a$
+country shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not good enough for the Parade Drug$
+Store, Bournemouth, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll dispense with your services as from this$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre losing a good man,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, but Mr. Goldberg did$
+not seem to take that loss to heart.$
+$
+All ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] jobs ended violently. He never conceived$
+of them ending in any other way, and invariably regarded the sum of$
+money which was received in lieu of notice, or as compensation for$
+breach of contract, as being something in the nature of a nest-egg which$
+a kindly Providence had foreordained, and he was neither cast down nor$
+elated by the crisis in his affairs when, by a fortunate accident, he$
+met Mary Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tthe fortune was apparent, but the accident belonged to$
+the category which determined the hour at which trains leave stations.$
+$
+Hitherto, on the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys part, these meetings had been fraught with a$
+certain amount of apprehension, if not terror. They had begun when$
+Timothy had stopped her on the morning after his quarrel with Lady$
+Maxell, and had made bland inquiries as to that lady‚M-^@M-^Ys condition. Then$
+she had been in a panic and frantically anxious to end the interview,$
+and it required all her self-restraint to prevent her flying at top$
+speed from this wicked young man who had been so abominably rude.$
+$
+At their second meeting he had greeted her as an old friend, and she had$
+left him with the illusion of a life-time acquaintance. Hereafter$
+matters went smoothly, and they went so because Timothy Anderson was$
+unlike any of the other boys she had ever met.$
+$
+He paid her no compliments, he did not grow sentimental, he neither$
+tried to hold her hand nor kiss her, nor was he ever oppressed by that$
+overwhelming melancholy which is the heritage and pride of youth.$
+$
+Not once did he hint at an early decline or the possibility of his going$
+away to die in far lands. Instead he kept her in screams of laughter at$
+his interpretation of movie plays in the making. He did not ask for a$
+keepsake; the only request he made of her in this direction was one$
+which first took her breath away. Thereafter she never met him unless$
+she had in the bag which slung from her wrist one small box of matches;$
+for ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson had never possessed or carried the means of$
+ignition for his cigarette for one whole hour together.$
+$
+Timothy told her most of what the proprietor of the Parade Drug Store$
+had told him. The girl thought it was a joke, because that was exactly$
+the way Timothy presented the matter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you won‚M-^@M-^Yt be going away soon?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not till I go abroad,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy calmly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going abroad too?‚M-^@M-^] she asked in surprise.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to Paris and Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^Tespecially to Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\and afterwards I may run across to Algeria or to Egypt.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him with a new respect. She was less impressed by the$
+great possessions which his plans betrayed than by his confident$
+independence, and dimly she wondered why he was working at a drug-store$
+for low wages and wondered, too, whether he was‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you blushing about?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt blushing,‚M-^@M-^] she protested; ‚M-^@M-^\I was just wondering whether I$
+could ever afford a trip like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you can,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\If I can afford it,$
+you can, can‚M-^@M-^Yt you? If I go abroad and stay at the best hotels, and go$
+joy rides in the Alps and plan all this when I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got fifteen$
+shillings over my rent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt fifteen shillings over your rent!‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, aghast.$
+‚M-^@M-^\But how can you go abroad without money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was genuinely astounded that she could ask so absurd a question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\A little thing like money$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt really count.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre very silly,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, there was something I wanted$
+to tell you, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may call me Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to call you Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she replied.$
+$
+He shook his head with a pained expression.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Yll be ever so much more sociable if you call me Timothy and I call$
+you Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We can be very sociable without that familiarity,‚M-^@M-^] she said severely.$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was just going to tell you something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They sat on the grass together, on the shadow fringe of a big oak and$
+the spring sunshine wove its restless arabesques on her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\that last night I had two queer$
+experiences and I was scared; oh, scared to death!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eating things at night,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy oracularly, ‚M-^@M-^\especially before$
+you go to bed‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt dreaming,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly, ‚M-^@M-^\nor was it a nightmare. I$
+won‚M-^@M-^Yt tell you if you‚M-^@M-^Yre so horrid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym only speaking as an ex-chemist and druggist,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gravely;$
+‚M-^@M-^\but please forgive me. Tell me what it is, Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Mary Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he compromised.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\First I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the least worst,‚M-^@M-^] she began. ‚M-^@M-^\It happened about one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the morning. I had gone to bed awfully tired, but somehow I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt sleep, so I got up and walked about the room. I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt like$
+putting on the light because that meant drawing down the blinds which I$
+had let up when I went to bed, and the blinds make such a noise that I$
+thought the whole of the house would hear. So I put on my dressing-gown$
+and sat by the window. It was rather chilly, but my wrap was warm, and$
+sitting there I dozed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know how long, but it was nearly an hour,$
+I think. When I woke up I saw a man right in the centre of the lawn.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What sort of a man?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is the peculiar thing about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt a white$
+man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A coon?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I think it must have been a Moor. He wore a long white dress that$
+reached down to his ankles, and over that he had a big, heavy black$
+cloak.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He went round the corner of the house towards uncle‚M-^@M-^Ys private stairway$
+and he was gone quite a long time. My first thought was to awaken uncle$
+and tell him, but then I remembered that Sir John had spent a long time$
+in Morocco and possibly he knew that the man was about the house. You$
+see, we have had Moorish visitors before, when ships have come to Poole.$
+Once we had a very important man, a Kaid, and Sir John made queer tea$
+for him in glasses with mint and stuff. So I just didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what to$
+do. Whilst I was wondering whether I ought not at least to wake Lady$
+Maxell, he reappeared, walked across the lawn and went down the path$
+which leads to the back entrance‚M-^@M-^Tyou‚M-^@M-^Yre laughing at me,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you mistake for a laugh,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\is merely one$
+large smile of pleasure at being in your confidence.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was in two minds as to whether she would be angry or pleased, but$
+his tone changed to a more serious one.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like the idea of the gaudy East wandering loose under your$
+bedroom window in the middle of the night,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell Lady$
+Maxell this morning?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, she was up very early and has been out all day. I have not seen$
+her‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, she was not at breakfast. Now I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the really$
+serious thing that happened, and I do hope, Mr. Anderson, that you won‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+be flippant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Trust me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl had no reason to complain of his attitude when she had$
+described the shooting incident. He was aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is terrible!‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, it might have hit you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it might have hit me,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+whole point of my story, so far as you are concerned‚M-^@M-^TI mean, so far as$
+I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she added hastily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So fax as I am concerned too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\I just hate the$
+idea of anything even frightening you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She rose hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am going to shop now,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the hurry?‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ignoring his question, ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you to$
+think that uncle is feeling badly about you because of what has happened$
+in the house. He spoke to me of you last night, and he spoke very$
+nicely. I am worried to death about Sir John. He has made enemies in his$
+life, and I am sure that this shooting affair is the sequel to some old$
+feud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should say that is so,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He looked down at the grass very thoughtfully and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll go home,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I had better sleep this afternoon if I$
+am to be up all night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Up all night?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\What is happening? Is there a$
+ball or something?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will be something livelier than a ball,‚M-^@M-^] he said grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if I$
+find anybody in your garden to-night. And Miss Maxell, if you look out$
+of your window and you see a solitary figure on sentry-go don‚M-^@M-^Yt shoot,$
+because it will be me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] she gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt do it, Mr. Anderson. Uncle$
+would be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped her with a gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Possibly nobody will come to-night,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and as likely as not I$
+shall be pinched by the police as a suspicious character. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+chance that somebody will come, and that‚M-^@M-^Ys the chance I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to$
+take.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XII$
+$
+$
+TRUE to his word, he returned to his lodgings and spent the afternoon$
+in slumber. He had the gift which all great men possess, of being able$
+to sleep at will. He was staying at a boarding-house, and occupied a$
+room which had originally been a side veranda, but had been walled in$
+and converted into an extra bedroom. It was a remarkably convenient room$
+for him, as he had discovered on previous occasions. He had but to open$
+the window and drop on to the grass to make his exit without anybody in$
+the house being the wiser. More to the point, he could return at any$
+hour by the same route without disturbing the household.$
+$
+He had his supper, and whilst it was still very light he went out to$
+reconnoitre Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys demesne. He was able to make the circuit of the$
+house, which occupied a corner site and was isolated by two lanes, and$
+he saw nobody until, returning to the front of the house, a car drove up$
+and a woman alighted.$
+$
+He had no difficulty in recognising Lady Maxell, but the taxi interested$
+him more than the lady. It was smothered with mud and had evidently come$
+a long journey.$
+$
+As evidently she had hired it in some distant town and she had not as$
+yet finished with it, because she gave the man some directions and$
+money, and from the profound respect which the chauffeur showed, it was$
+clear that that money was merely a tip.$
+$
+Timothy stood where he could clearly be seen, but her back was toward$
+him all the time and she did not so much as glance in his direction when$
+she passed through the gate and up the garden path.$
+$
+It was curious, thought Timothy, that she did not take the car up the$
+drive to the house. More curious was it that she should, at this late$
+hour of the evening, have further use for it.$
+$
+He returned to his room, full of theories, the majority of which were$
+wholly wild and improbable. He lay on his bed, indulging in those dreams$
+which made up the happiest part of his life. Of late he had taken a new$
+and a more radiant pattern to the web of his fancy and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, fiddlesticks!‚M-^@M-^] he said in disgust, rolling over and sitting up with$
+a yawn.$
+$
+He heard the feet of the boarders on the gravel path outside, and once$
+he heard a girl say evidently to a visitor:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you see that funny room! That is Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was still an hour or so to be passed, and he joined the party in$
+the parlour so restless and distrait as to attract attention and a$
+little mild raillery from his fellow guests. He went back to his room,$
+turned on the light and pulled a trunk from under the bed.$
+$
+Somehow his mind had been running all day upon that erring cousin whose$
+name he bore and whose disappearance from public life was such a$
+mystery. Possibly it was Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys words which had brought Alfred$
+Cartwright to his mind. His mother had left him a number of family$
+documents, which, with the indolence of youth, he had never examined$
+very closely. He had the impression that they consisted in the main of$
+receipts, old diplomas of his father‚M-^@M-^Ys (who was an engineer) and sundry$
+other family documents which were not calculated to excite the curiosity$
+of the adventurous youth.$
+$
+He took out the two big envelopes in which these papers were kept and$
+turned them on to the bed, examining them one by one. Why his cousin$
+should be in his mind, why he should have taken this action at that$
+particular moment, the psychologist and the psychical expert alone can$
+explain. They may produce in explanation such esoteric phenomena as$
+auras, influences, and telepathies, and perhaps they are right.$
+$
+He had not searched long before he came upon a small package of$
+newspaper cuttings, bound about by a rubber band. He read them at first$
+without interest, and then without comprehension. There was one cutting,$
+however, which had been clipped from its context, which seemed to tell$
+the whole story of the rest. It ran:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\When Cartwright stood up for sentence he did not seem to be$
+    greatly troubled by his serious position. As the words ‚M-^@M-^Xtwenty$
+    years‚M-^@M-^Y passed Mr. Justice Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips, he fell back as if he$
+    had been shot. Then, springing to the edge of the dock, he$
+    hurled an epithet at his lordship. Some of his business$
+    associates suggest that the learned judge was a partner of$
+    Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^Tan astonishing and most improper suggestion to$
+    make. In view of the statement that the prisoner made before the$
+    trial, when suggestions had been made in a newspaper that the$
+    judge had been connected with him in business years before, and$
+    remembering that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys statement was to the effect that$
+    he had had no business transactions with the judge, it seems as$
+    though the outburst was made in a fit of spleen at the severity$
+    of the sentence. Sir John Maxell, after the case, took the$
+    unusual step of informing a Press representative that he$
+    intended placing his affairs in the hands of a committee for$
+    investigation, and had invited the Attorney-General to appoint$
+    that committee. ‚M-^@M-^XI insist upon this being done,‚M-^@M-^Y he said,$
+    ‚M-^@M-^Xbecause after the prisoner‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation I should not feel$
+    comfortable until an impartial committee had examined my$
+    affairs.‚M-^@M-^Y It is understood that after the investigation the$
+    learned judge intends retiring from the Bench.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy gasped. So that was the explanation. That was why Maxell had$
+written to him, that was why he made no reference at all to his father,$
+but to this disreputable cousin of his. Slowly he returned the package$
+to its envelope, dropped it into his trunk and pushed the trunk under$
+the bed.$
+$
+And that was the secret of Cousin Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys disappearance. He might$
+have guessed it; he might even have known had he troubled to look at$
+these papers.$
+$
+He sat on the bed, his hands clasping his knees. It was not a pleasant$
+reflection that he had a relative, and a relative moreover after whom he$
+was named, serving what might be a life sentence in a convict$
+establishment. But what made him think of the matter to-night?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson! Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round with a start. The man whose face was framed in the$
+open window might have been forty, fifty or sixty. It was a face heavily$
+seamed and sparsely bearded‚M-^@M-^Ta hollow-eyed, hungry face, but those eyes$
+burnt like fire. Timothy jumped up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Who are you ‚M-^@M-^XTimothying‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] the man laughed unpleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Can I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, you can come in,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He wondered what old acquaintance this was who had come to the tramp$
+level, and rapidly turned over in his mind all the possible candidates$
+for trampdom he had met.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the man again. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yve tracked you$
+here, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve been sitting in those bushes for two hours. I heard one$
+of the boarders say that it was your window and I waited till it was$
+dark before I came out.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All this is highly interesting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, surveying the shrunken$
+figure without enthusiasm, ‚M-^@M-^\but who are you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had a provisional pardon,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and they put me in a$
+sanatorium‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Yve something the matter with one of my lungs. It was$
+always a trouble to me. I was supposed to stay in the sanatorium‚M-^@M-^Tthat$
+was one of the terms on which I was pardoned‚M-^@M-^Tbut I escaped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy stared at him with open mouth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alfred Cartwright!‚M-^@M-^] he breathed.$
+$
+The man nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys me,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Timothy looked down at the edge of the black box.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that is why I was thinking about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, this beats$
+all! Sit down, won‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pulled a chair up for his visitor and again gazed on him with$
+curiosity but without affection. Something in Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys attitude annoyed$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not glad to see me?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not very,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\The truth is, you‚M-^@M-^Yve only just come into$
+existence so far as I am concerned. I thought you were dead.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not until a few minutes ago. I was reading the cuttings about your$
+trial‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that was what you were reading?‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to see ‚M-^@M-^Yem$
+one of these days. Do you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve come for?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was only at that moment that Sir John flashed through Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys mind.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I guess what you‚M-^@M-^Yve come after,‚M-^@M-^] he said slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre here to see$
+Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym here to see Mister Justice Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man between his teeth.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took the stump of a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lit it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\John Maxell and I have a score to settle, and it is going to be settled$
+very soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tide and weather permitting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy flippantly, recovering his$
+self-possession. ‚M-^@M-^\All that vendetta stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt go, Mr. Cartwright.‚M-^@M-^]$
+Then he asked in a flash: ‚M-^@M-^\Did you shoot at him last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise was a convincing reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shoot at him? I only got to this place this afternoon. It‚M-^@M-^Ys more likely$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys waiting to shoot at me, for the sanatorium people will have$
+telegraphed to him the moment I was missing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy walked to the window and pulled down the blinds.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now tell me, Mr. Cartwright, before we go any farther, do you still$
+persist in the story you told the court, that the judge was a party to$
+your swindle?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A party to it!‚M-^@M-^] said the other man furiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course he was! I was$
+using the money of my companies to buy concessions from the Moorish$
+Government, as much on his behalf as on mine. He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt in the Brigot$
+swindle‚M-^@M-^Tbut he held shares in the company I was financing. We located a$
+gold mine in the Angera country, and Maxell and I went across to Europe$
+every year regularly to look after our property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We had to keep it quiet because we secured the concessions from the$
+Pretender, knowing that he‚M-^@M-^Yd put the Sultan out of business the moment$
+he got busy. If it had been known, the Sultan would have repudiated the$
+concession, and our Government would have upheld the repudiation. Maxell$
+speaks the language like a native, and I learnt enough to get on with El$
+Mograb, who is the biggest thing amongst the rebel tribes. El Mograb$
+wanted us to stay there, Maxell and I; he‚M-^@M-^Yd have made us shereefs or$
+pashas, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd have done it, because I knew there was going to be an$
+investigation sooner or later into the affairs of my companies. But$
+Maxell wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have it. He always pretended that, so far as he knew, my$
+financing was straight. You know the rest,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\When I came before$
+Maxell, I thought I was safe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John allowed his affairs to be inspected,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\If he$
+had been engaged with you in this Morocco business, there must have been$
+papers to prove it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed harshly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course he‚M-^@M-^Yd allow his affairs to be investigated,‚M-^@M-^] he sneered. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you think that old fox couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt _cache_ all the documents that put him$
+wrong? Papers? Why, he must have enough papers to hang him, if you could$
+only find ‚M-^@M-^Yem!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+There was one thing he was determined that this man should _not_ do, and$
+that was to disturb the peace of mind, not of Sir John Maxell or his$
+wife, but of a certain goddess whose bedroom overlooked the lawn.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What am I going to do?‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going up to get$
+my share. And he‚M-^@M-^Yll be lucky if that‚M-^@M-^Ys all he loses. One of the mines$
+was sold to a syndicate last year‚M-^@M-^TI had news of it in gaol. He didn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+get much for it because he was in a hurry to sell‚M-^@M-^TI suppose his other$
+investments must have been going wrong twelve months ago‚M-^@M-^Tbut I want my$
+share of that!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you had best see Sir John in the morning. I will arrange an$
+interview.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the morning!‚M-^@M-^] said the other contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose you make the$
+arrangement, what would happen? When I went up there I should find a$
+couple of cops waiting to pinch me. I know John! I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and the man stared at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You think not?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\What has it to do with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite a lot,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely state that you will not see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright stroked his bristly chin undecidedly and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, well,‚M-^@M-^] he said in a milder tone, ‚M-^@M-^\maybe you can fix things up for$
+me in the morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you sleeping to-night?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had money, a little; and he had arranged to sleep at the house of a$
+man he had known in better times. Timothy accompanied him through the$
+window and into the street, and walked with him to the end of the road.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If my gamble had come off, you‚M-^@M-^Yd have benefited, Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+man unexpectedly, breaking in upon another topic which they were$
+discussing.$
+$
+They parted, and Timothy watched him out of sight, then turned on and$
+walked in the opposite direction, to take up his self-imposed vigil.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIII$
+$
+$
+THERE was something in the air that was electrical, and Mary Maxell$
+felt it as she sat at supper with Sir John and his wife. Maxell was$
+unusually silent and his wife amazingly so. She was nervous and almost$
+jumped when a remark was addressed to her. The old truculence which$
+distinguished her every word and action, her readiness to take offence,$
+to see a slight in the most innocent remark, and her combativeness$
+generally, had disappeared; she was almost meek when she replied to her$
+husband‚M-^@M-^Ys questions.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just went round shopping and then decided to call on a girl I had$
+known a long time ago. She lives in the country, and I felt so nervous$
+and depressed this morning that I thought a ride in a taxi would do me$
+good.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you take our car?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt decide until the last moment to go out to her, and then I went$
+by train one way.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad you went into the fresh air,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it will do you good.$
+The country is not so beautiful as Honolulu, but it is not without its$
+attractions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was unusual for the Judge to be sarcastic, but it was less usual for$
+Lady Maxell to accept sarcasm without a retort. To Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise she$
+made no reply, though a faint smile curved those straight lips of hers$
+for a second.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it was a burglar last night?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good heavens, no!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\Burglars do not shoot up the house$
+they burgle.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it is safe to have all this money in the house?‚M-^@M-^] she$
+asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly safe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that need alarm you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+No further reference was made to the matter, and presently Sir John went$
+up to his study. Mrs. Maxell did not go to the parlour, but drew a chair$
+to the fire in the dining-room and read, and the girl followed her$
+example. Presently the elder woman left the room and was gone a quarter$
+of an hour before she returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, so sweetly that the girl was startled, ‚M-^@M-^\such an$
+annoying thing has happened‚M-^@M-^TI have lost the key of my wardrobe. You$
+borrowed one of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicates the other day‚M-^@M-^Twhere did you put$
+the ring?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+John Maxell was a methodical and systematic man. He had a duplicate set$
+of all the keys in the house, and these as a rule were kept in a small$
+wall-safe in his own bedroom. He had never invited his wife to use that$
+receptacle, but she had a shrewd idea that the combination which was$
+denied to her had been given to the girl.$
+$
+Mary hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think if you asked Uncle‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the lady, ‚M-^@M-^\if I went to him now, he‚M-^@M-^Yd never forgive$
+me. If you know where the keys are, be an angel and get them for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl rose, and Lady Maxell followed her upstairs. Her own room was$
+next to her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys and communicated, but the door was invariably$
+locked on Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys side. Presently the girl came in to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here they are,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Please let me put them back quickly. I feel$
+very guilty at having taken them at all without his permission.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And for goodness‚M-^@M-^Y sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt tell him,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, examining the$
+keys.$
+$
+At last she found the one she wanted, but was a long time in the$
+process. She opened her bureau and the girl took the big key-ring from$
+her hand with such evident relief that Lady Maxell laughed.$
+$
+It had been easier than she thought and unless she made a blunder, the$
+key she had selected from the bunch while she was fumbling at the$
+bureau, would make just the difference‚M-^@M-^Tjust the difference.$
+$
+It was not customary for Sir John to come down from his study to enjoy$
+the ladies‚M-^@M-^Y company after dinner, but on this evening he made an$
+exception to his rule. He found his wife and ward reading, one on each$
+side of the fireplace. Lady Maxell looked up when her husband came in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a curious story, John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think it must be an$
+American story, about a woman who robbed her husband and the police$
+refused to arrest her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing curious about that,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\in law a wife$
+cannot rob her husband or a husband his wife.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that if you came to my Honolulu estate and stole my pearls,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said banteringly, ‚M-^@M-^\I could not have you arrested.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except for walking in my sleep!‚M-^@M-^] he said smilingly, and they both$
+laughed together.$
+$
+He had never seen her so amiable, and for the first time that day‚M-^@M-^Tit$
+had been a very trying and momentous day‚M-^@M-^The had his misgivings. She,$
+with the memory of her good day‚M-^@M-^Ys work, the excellent terms she had$
+arranged with the skipper of the _Lord Lawrence_, due to leave$
+Southampton for Cadiz at daylight the next morning, had no misgivings at$
+all, especially when she thought of a key she had placed under her$
+pillow. She had had the choice of two boats, the _Lord Lawrence_ and the$
+_Saffi_, but the _Saffi‚M-^@M-^Ys_ voyage would have been a long one, and its$
+port of destination might hold discomfort which she had no wish to$
+experience.$
+$
+The household retired at eleven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock, and it was past midnight before$
+Sadie Maxell heard her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys door close, and half an hour later$
+before the click of the switch told her that his light had been$
+extinguished.$
+$
+He was a ready sleeper, but she gave him yet another half-hour before$
+she opened the door of her bedroom and stepped out into the black$
+corridor. She moved noiselessly towards the study, her only fear being$
+that the baronet had locked the door before he came out. But this fear$
+was not well founded, and the door yielded readily to her touch. She was$
+dressed, and carried only a small attach√© case filled with the bare$
+necessities for the voyage.$
+$
+She pushed the catch of her electric lamp, located the safe and opened$
+it with no difficulty. She found herself surprisingly short of breath,$
+and her heart beat at such a furious rate that she thought it must be$
+audible to everybody in the house. The envelope with the money lay at$
+the bottom of the others, and she transferred its contents to her$
+attach√© case in a few seconds.$
+$
+Then her heart stood still. . . .$
+$
+It was only the faintest creak she heard, but it came from a corner of$
+the room where the door leading to the cupboard stairway was placed. She$
+saw a faint grey line of light appear‚M-^@M-^Tthe stairway had a glass roof and$
+admitted enough light to show her that the door was slowly opening. She$
+had to bite her lips to stop herself from screaming. To make her escape$
+or to rouse Sir John was impossible, and she opened the attach√© case$
+again, and with trembling fingers felt for the little revolver which she$
+had taken from her drawer. She felt safer now, yet she had not the$
+courage to switch on the light.$
+$
+She saw the figure of a man silhouetted in the opening, then the door$
+closed, and her terror bred of itself a certain courage.$
+$
+She flashed the light full on his face. The dead silence was broken when$
+she whispered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, God! Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who‚M-^@M-^Ys that?‚M-^@M-^] he whispered, and snatched the torch from her hand.$
+$
+He looked at her long and curiously, and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I expected to find that Maxell had taken most of my possessions,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I never thought he would take my wife!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us see what all this is about,‚M-^@M-^] boomed the big voice of John Maxell$
+almost in the man‚M-^@M-^Ys ear, he was so close, and suddenly the room was$
+flooded with light.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIV$
+$
+$
+THE self-appointed watcher found time pass very slowly. Twelve and one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock struck from a distant church, but there was no sign of midnight$
+assassins, and the house, looking very solemn and quiet in the light of$
+a waning moon, irritated and annoyed him. From the roadway where he$
+paced silently to and fro‚M-^@M-^The had taken the precaution of wearing a pair$
+of rubber-soled shoes‚M-^@M-^The could glimpse Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys window, and once he$
+thought he saw her looking out.$
+$
+He made a point of walking entirely round the house twice in every hour,$
+and it was on one of these excursions that he heard a sound which$
+brought him to a standstill. It was a sound like two pieces of flat$
+board being smacked together sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tap . . . tap!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and listened, but heard nothing further. Then he retraced his$
+footsteps to the front of the house and waited, but there was no sound$
+or sign. Another half-hour passed, and then a patrolling policeman came$
+along on the other side of the roadway. At the sight of the young man he$
+crossed the road, and Jim recognised an acquaintance of his drug-store$
+days. Nothing was to be gained by being evasive or mysterious, and$
+Timothy told the policeman frankly his object.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I heard about the shooting last night,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and the$
+inspector offered to put one of our men on duty here, but Sir John$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt hear of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took a professional look at the house, and pointed to its dark upper$
+windows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That house is asleep‚M-^@M-^Tyou needn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about that,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\besides,$
+it‚M-^@M-^Yll be daylight in two hours, and a burglar wants that time to get$
+home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy paused irresolutely. It seemed absurd to wait any longer, and$
+besides, to be consistent he must be prepared to adopt this watchman$
+r√¥le every night.$
+$
+There was no particular reason why Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy should choose$
+this night or any other. He had half expected to see Cartwright and was$
+agreeably disappointed that he did not loom into view.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre right,‚M-^@M-^] he said to the policeman. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll walk along down$
+the road with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They must have walked a quarter of a mile, and were standing chatting at$
+the corner of the street, when a sound, borne clearly on the night air,$
+made both men look back in the direction whence they had come. They saw$
+two glaring spots of light somewhere in the vicinity of the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+house.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a car,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, ‚M-^@M-^\what is it doing there at this time$
+of the morning? There is nobody sick in the house, is there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head. Already he had begun to walk back, and the$
+policeman, sensing something wrong, kept him company. They had covered$
+half the distance which separated them from the car, when it began to$
+move toward them, gathering speed. It flashed past and Timothy saw$
+nothing save the driver, for the hood was raised and its canvas blinds$
+hid whatever passenger it carried.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It came in from the other end of the avenue,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman$
+unnecessarily. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe Sir John is going a long journey and is starting$
+early.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell would have told me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, troubled. ‚M-^@M-^\I nearly took$
+a chance and made a jump for that car.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was one of the few chances Timothy did not take, and one that he$
+bitterly regretted afterwards.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical policeman, ‚M-^@M-^\I should have been looking$
+for the ambulance for you now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was no longer satisfied to play the r√¥le of the silent watcher.$
+When he came to the house he went boldly through the gate and up the$
+drive, and his warrant for the intrusion was the officer who followed$
+him. It was then that he saw the open window of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys room, and his$
+heart leapt into his mouth. He quickened his step, but just as he came$
+under the window, she appeared, and Timothy sighed his relief.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is that you?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a low worried voice; ‚M-^@M-^\is that Mr. Anderson?$
+Thank heaven you‚M-^@M-^Yve come! Wait, I will come down and open the door for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked to the entrance, and presently the door was opened and the$
+girl, dressed in a wrapper, appeared. She tried to keep her voice$
+steady, but the strain of the past half-hour had been too much for her,$
+and she was on the verge of tears when Timothy put his arm about her$
+shaking shoulders and forced her down into a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and tell us what has happened.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at the officer and tried to speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a servant,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman; ‚M-^@M-^\perhaps he knows something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A man dressed in shirt and trousers was coming down the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can‚M-^@M-^Yt make him hear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\or Lady Maxell, either.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know, sir. The young lady woke me and asked me to rouse Sir$
+John.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sorry I am so silly. I am probably$
+making a lot of trouble over nothing. It happened nearly an hour ago, I$
+was asleep and I heard a sound; thought I was dreaming of what happened$
+last night. It sounded like two shots, but, whatever it was, it woke$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know. I thought I heard them too,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you were out there all the time?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and put out her hand$
+to him.$
+$
+For that look she gave him Timothy would have stayed out the three$
+hundred and sixty-five nights in the year.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I lay for a very long time, thinking that the sound would wake my$
+uncle, but I heard nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is your room near Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys?‚M-^@M-^] asked the policeman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, mine is on this side of the building; Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+sleep on the other side. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what it was, but something alarmed$
+me and filled me with terror‚M-^@M-^Tsomething that made my flesh go rough and$
+cold‚M-^@M-^Toh, it was horrible!‚M-^@M-^] she shuddered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt endure it any longer, so I got out of bed and went out into$
+the corridor to wake uncle. Just then I heard a sound outside my window,$
+but I was just too terrified to look out. Then I heard a motor-car and$
+footsteps on the path outside. I went to Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys door and knocked,$
+but got no answer. Then I tried Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys door, but there was no$
+answer there either. So I went to Johnson‚M-^@M-^Ys room and woke him;‚M-^@M-^] she$
+looked at Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Tthought that you might be there, so I came$
+back to the open window and looked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Show me Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman to the servant, and the$
+three men passed up the stairs, followed by the girl.$
+$
+The door which the man indicated was locked, and even when the policeman$
+hammered on the panel there was no response.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think the key of my door will unlock almost any of the room doors,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the girl suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John told me once that all the room locks$
+were made on the same plan.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She went away and came back with a key. The policeman fitted it in the$
+lock and opened the door, feeling for and finding the electric switch as$
+he entered. The room was empty, and apparently the bed had not been$
+occupied.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where does that door lead?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That leads to Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\there is a key on$
+this side.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This door he found was open and again they found an empty room and a bed$
+which had not been slept in. They looked at one another.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Sir John be in his study till late?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is at the end of the corridor,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a broken voice, for she$
+felt that the study held some dreadful secret.$
+$
+This door was locked too, locked from the inside. By now the policeman$
+was standing on no ceremony, and with a quick thrust of his shoulder he$
+broke the lock, and the door flew open.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us have a little light,‚M-^@M-^] he said, unconsciously copying words which$
+had been spoken in that room an hour before.$
+$
+The room was empty, but here at any rate was evidence. The safe stood$
+open, the fireplace was filled with glowing ashes, and the air of the$
+room was pungent with the scent of burnt paper.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is this?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy, pointing to the ground.$
+$
+The floor of the study was covered with a thick, biscuit-coloured$
+carpet, and ‚M-^@M-^\this‚M-^@M-^] was a round, dark stain which was still wet. The$
+policeman went on his knees and examined it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is blood,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly; ‚M-^@M-^\there‚M-^@M-^Ys another patch near the door.$
+Where does this door lead? Catch that girl, she‚M-^@M-^Ys fainting!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was just in time to slip his arm round Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys waist before she$
+collapsed. By this time the household was aroused, and a woman servant$
+was on the spot to take charge of Mary. When Timothy had rejoined the$
+policeman, that officer had discovered where the door led.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You go down a stairway into the garden,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It looks as if two$
+shots were fired here. Look, there‚M-^@M-^Ys the mark of both of them on the$
+wall.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you suggest that two people have been killed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The policeman nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\One was shot in the middle of the room, and one was probably shot on$
+the way to the door. What do you make of this?‚M-^@M-^] and he held up a bag,$
+discoloured and weather-worn, with a handle to which was fastened a long$
+length of rusty wire.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is empty,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, examining the contents of the little$
+grip which, up till an hour before, had held John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys most$
+jealously guarded secrets.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll use this ‚M-^@M-^Yphone,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better stay by, Mr.$
+Anderson. We shall want your evidence‚M-^@M-^Tit will be important. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+often we have a man watching outside a house where a murder is$
+committed‚M-^@M-^Tprobably two.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The sun had risen before the preliminary interrogation and the search of$
+the house and grounds had been concluded. Blewitt the detective, who had$
+taken charge of the case, came into the dining-room, where a worried$
+servant was serving coffee for the investigators, and dropped down on to$
+a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue and there‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue alone,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and drew from$
+his pocket a soft hat. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you recognise this, Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that was worn last night by the man I spoke to you$
+about.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I could swear to it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Where did you find it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Outside,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective; ‚M-^@M-^\and that is all we have to go on. There$
+is no sign of any body. My first theory stands.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You believe that the murderer carried Sir John and Lady Maxell into the$
+car and drove away with them?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\but that pre-supposes that$
+the chauffeur was in the plot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He may have been and he may have been terrorised,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Even a taxi-driver will be obliging if you stick a gun in his stomach.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Miss Maxell have heard‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] began Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell heard,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\but was afraid to look out.$
+She also heard two shots. My theory is that Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+were killed, that the murderer first locked both the bedrooms, went$
+through Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys papers, presumably to discover something$
+incriminating himself, and to destroy such documents.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But why not leave the bodies?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because without the bodies no indictment of murder could hold against$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson turned as the girl came in. She was looking very tired,$
+but she was calmer than she had been earlier in the morning.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is there any news?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have searched every inch of the ground,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated to ask the question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am afraid,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy gently, ‚M-^@M-^\that there is very little hope.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But have you searched everywhere?‚M-^@M-^] insisted the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everywhere,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+Soon after, Timothy took the girl away to an hotel for breakfast and to$
+arrange for a room, and the house was left in charge of the police.$
+Later came the famous detective Gilborne, who made an independent$
+search, but he, like his predecessors, failed to discover any further$
+evidence, because he also knew nothing of the disused well, which lay$
+hidden under a rubbish heap.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XV$
+$
+$
+WHO killed Sir John Maxell and his wife?$
+$
+Where had their bodies been hidden? These were the two questions which$
+were to agitate England for the traditional space of nine days. For one$
+day, at any rate, they formed the sole topic of speculation amongst the$
+intelligent section of fifty million people.$
+$
+The first question was easier to answer than the second. It was obvious$
+to the newsmen that the murderer was Cartwright, whose threats of$
+vengeance were recalled and whose appearance at Bournemouth had been$
+described at second-hand by the detective in charge of the case.$
+First-hand information was for the moment denied the pressmen, for$
+Timothy, fully dressed, lay on his bed in a sound sleep. Happily for$
+him, neither then nor later did any of the enterprising newspaper men$
+associate the ‚M-^@M-^\A. C.‚M-^@M-^] in his name with the wanted criminal. He was at$
+least spared that embarrassment.$
+$
+But the story of his vigil as ‚M-^@M-^\a friend of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] was in print long$
+before he woke up to find a small and impatient army of reporters$
+waiting to interview him. He answered the reporters‚M-^@M-^Y interrogations as$
+briefly as possible, bathed and changed and made his way to the hotel$
+where the girl was. She was leaving as he arrived, and the warmth of her$
+greeting almost banished the depression which lay upon him. She put her$
+arm through his so naturally that he did not realise his wonderful$
+fortune.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve got something to tell you,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\unless you know already.$
+All my money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped with a gasp.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean that?‚M-^@M-^] he said seriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is true,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe it was very little and my loss is$
+so insignificant compared with the other awful affair that I am not$
+worrying about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John had money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just seen his lawyers,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\they have been to the bank$
+and there is not a hundred pounds to his credit, and that amount will be$
+absorbed by the cheques he has drawn. He drew a very, very large sum,$
+including my money, from the bank two days ago. You know,‚M-^@M-^] she went on,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that Sir John contemplated leaving for America? He had already$
+given me a hint, asking me how long it would take me to pack my$
+belongings, and I fancy that had something to do with the telegram he$
+received‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Announcing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys escape,‚M-^@M-^] nodded Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was so kind and so gentle,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, her eyes filling with$
+tears, ‚M-^@M-^\that to me he was more like a father. Oh, it is awful, awful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you?‚M-^@M-^] asked the agitated Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do? Good$
+heavens! It is dreadful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall have to work,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl practically and with a little$
+smile. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that will kill me. Hundreds of thousands of girls$
+have to work for their living, Timothy, and I shall have to work for$
+mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy drew a long breath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not if I can help it, you won‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sure I shall make a$
+lot of money. I can feel it in my bones. If a man takes a job‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt talk like that,‚M-^@M-^] she said, pressing his arm, ‚M-^@M-^\and anyway,$
+how could I let you help me or keep me? That sort of thing isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+done‚M-^@M-^Tnot by nice girls.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She laughed, but became sober again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know that Sir John was very much interested in you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In me?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I told you so the other day. I think he liked you, because he was$
+saying how uncomfortable you must be at Vermont House, living in that$
+queer little room of yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did he know I was living at Vermont House?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Vermont House happens to be Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys property,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\In fact, I$
+think it is the only realisable piece of property he has, now that the$
+money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What shall you do immediately?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I think the first step is to get out of$
+this hotel, which is much too expensive for me. I have a few pounds in$
+the bank, but that won‚M-^@M-^Yt last very long.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At his earnest entreaty she agreed to see a solicitor and appoint him to$
+save whatever was possible from the wreckage of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys estate. Two$
+hours passed like as many minutes, until Timothy remembered that he had$
+an appointment with a London reporter‚M-^@M-^Tone Brennan. Brennan he had known$
+in his cinema days, and Timothy literally fell upon his neck.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to tell the boys that hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt already been told,‚M-^@M-^] he said,$
+putting down the newspaper which Brennan handed to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I am as anxious$
+for news as you are. Have there been any developments?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter, ‚M-^@M-^\except that Sir John had no money at the$
+bank and no money could be found in the house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I know,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all his securities were drawn out two days ago.$
+That was the stuff that Cartwright was after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does Miss Maxell know‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Brennan began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does know and she took it like a brick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was about twenty thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] Brennan went on. ‚M-^@M-^\The only other$
+clue the police have is that the safe was opened by Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicate$
+key. The old man had two sets made, one of which he used to keep in his$
+combination safe in his bedroom and the other he carried around with$
+him. Miss Maxell told a story that the night before the murder Lady$
+Maxell asked her to secure possession of the keys in order to open a$
+bureau.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see. Is it suggested that Lady Maxell detached the key of the safe$
+and that it was she who opened it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one theory,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\the police have miles of ‚M-^@M-^Yem!$
+They‚M-^@M-^Yve got everything except the bodies and the murderer. Now come out$
+with that story, Anderson! You must know a great deal more than you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+told, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym simply without a new fact that these evening papers$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got, to hang my story on. Why did Cartwright come to your room,$
+anyway? Do you know him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was an acquaintance of my father‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and perhaps he thought I knew Maxell better than I did.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sounds pretty thin,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter. ‚M-^@M-^\Why should he come to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose I am the only person he knew or knew about,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+patiently. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose he‚M-^@M-^Yd been all round Bournemouth trying to find a$
+familiar name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the reporter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I was a kid when he went to gaol. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+imagine I knew him at all, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had gone out to meet the girl, forgetting to take his watch, and now$
+he was looking round for it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a theory,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Lady Maxell isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+dead at all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Cartwright killed Maxell and Lady Maxell witnessed the murder.$
+Suppose this fellow had to decide whether he would kill the witness or$
+whether he would go away with her? You said the motor-car which came to$
+the house in the middle of the night was the same as that in which Lady$
+Maxell came home. Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely that she should have told the$
+murderer, for some reason or other, that the car was coming, because$
+evidently she had arranged for it to come, and that they went away$
+together? Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely, too, that she was in the plot, and that, so$
+far from being a victim, she was one of the criminals? We know her$
+antecedents. There was some trouble over her stabbing a young American,$
+Reggie van Rhyn. In fact, most of the evidence seems to incriminate her.$
+There is the key, for example. Who else but she could have taken the$
+duplicate key? Doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt it look as though she planned the whole thing,$
+and that her accomplice came in at the last moment to help her get away$
+and possibly to settle Sir John?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take the incident of the two locked bedrooms. Obviously somebody who$
+lived in the house and who knew the family routine must have done that.$
+Both Sir John and Lady Maxell were in the habit of fastening their doors$
+at night, and the servants did not go into the bedrooms unless they were$
+rung for. It seems to me fairly clear that Lady Maxell locked the doors$
+so that the suspicions of the servants should not be aroused in the$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If I had your powers of deduction,‚M-^@M-^] said the admiring Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+should never miss a winner. Where the blazes is my watch?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try under the pillow,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I never put it there,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy, but nevertheless turned the$
+pillow over and stood gaping.$
+$
+For beneath the pillow was a long, stout envelope with a tell-tale blood$
+stain in one corner.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake!‚M-^@M-^] breathed Timothy, and took up the package.$
+$
+It bore no address and was sealed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What on earth is this?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can tell you what those stains are,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Brennan. ‚M-^@M-^\Is$
+there any name on it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open it,‚M-^@M-^] suggested the reporter, and the other obeyed.$
+$
+The contents were even more astonishing, for they consisted of a thick$
+pad of money. They were new Bank of England notes and were bound about$
+by a tight band of paper. On the band was written in Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+handwriting:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Proceeds of the sale of stocks held in trust for Miss Mary$
+    Maxell. ¬£21,300.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The detective in charge of the case was a man of many theories. But his$
+new theory was an uncomfortable one for Timothy Anderson.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This puts a new light upon the case,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+being perfectly frank with you, Mr. Anderson, that the new light isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+very favourable to you. Here you are, outside the building when the$
+crime is committed. You are seen by a policeman a few minutes after the$
+shots are fired, and a portion of the money stolen from the house is$
+discovered under your pillow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Discovered by me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\in the presence of a witness. And are$
+you suggesting that, whilst I was with your policeman, I was also$
+driving the car, or that I was wearing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys cap which was found$
+in the grounds? Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve the finger-print of your man and you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+at liberty to compare it with mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a finger-print anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\it is the print$
+of a knuckle and we do not keep a record of knuckles. No, I admit that$
+the motor-car conflicts a little bit with my theory. Have you any$
+suggestion to offer?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The only suggestion I can make,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is that Cartwright, in a$
+hurry to get away and knowing the position of my room, hid the money$
+there for fear he should be caught with the goods. At any rate, if I$
+were the criminal I would not hide a bloodstained envelope under my$
+pillow. I should at least have the intelligence to burn the envelope and$
+put the money where the servants of this house could not find it. Why,$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt you see,‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously, ‚M-^@M-^\that any of the servants at this$
+boarding-house would have found the envelope if I hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The detective scratched his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a very queer case.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And it is being investigated by very queer people,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+irritably.$
+$
+A little further investigation, however, relieved Timothy of all$
+suspicion. He had not returned to the house until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock that$
+morning. The maid, who had taken him a cup of tea at eight, noticing$
+that he had been out all night, thought it was an excellent opportunity$
+to straighten the room to ‚M-^@M-^\get it off her mind,‚M-^@M-^] as she said. She did$
+not remake the bed, but had tidied it. Whilst sweeping she had seen the$
+envelope lying on the floor near the open window and had picked it up$
+and, for want of a better place, thinking ‚M-^@M-^\it was private‚M-^@M-^] had slipped$
+it under Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys pillow.$
+$
+As Timothy had not been out of sight of the police since the tragedy$
+until his return to his lodgings, there could be no suggestion that he$
+had any part in hiding the envelope. Whatever irritation he felt was$
+dispelled by his large and generous satisfaction when the poverty which$
+threatened Mary was averted. But why should Cartwright hide the money$
+there? Why should he stop in his headlong flight to come to the window,$
+as evidently he did, and throw the package into the room? There were a$
+hundred places where he might have left it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That cousin stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt work,‚M-^@M-^] thought Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and if you think$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys going to rely upon his relationship with me and can use me to look$
+after his money, he‚M-^@M-^Ys made one large mistake.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw the girl again at the official inquiry, and met her on the day$
+after. She was going to Bath where she had some distant relations, and$
+they had met to say good-bye.$
+$
+It was a gloomy occasion‚M-^@M-^Tless gloomy for Timothy than for the girl,$
+because he was already planning a move to the town in which she was$
+taking up her quarters. This cheerful view was banished, however, when$
+she explained that her stay in Bath was merely a temporary expedient.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew has wired asking me to come‚M-^@M-^Tand it seems as good a place$
+as any for a few months. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I shall stay here any longer,‚M-^@M-^]$
+she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want a change of air and a change of scene. Timothy, I feel$
+that I shall never get over Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never is a very long time, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently, and she could$
+only wonder at the tender kindness in his voice.$
+$
+She had little time to wonder, however, for she had a proposition to$
+make to him and she hardly knew how to reduce it to words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you‚M-^@M-^Tare you‚M-^@M-^Tworking?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys broad smile answered her plainly that he was not.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact is,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt quite decided what I am going$
+to do. If you were going down to Bath for good, I was going down to Bath$
+also. Maybe I could start a druggist‚M-^@M-^Ys or buy a store, or run errands$
+for somebody. I am the most accommodating worker.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she began and stopped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he repeated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had an idea that maybe you would like to go on and conduct an$
+independent search‚M-^@M-^Tindependent of the police, I mean‚M-^@M-^Tand find$
+something about the man who killed Sir John, and perhaps bring him to$
+justice. You know, I think you are clever enough,‚M-^@M-^] she went on$
+hurriedly, ‚M-^@M-^\and it would be work after your own heart.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was looking at her steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly, ‚M-^@M-^\but that involves spending a$
+whole lot of money. What misguided person do you suggest would send me$
+out on that kind of job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I thought‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated, and then a little incoherently,$
+‚M-^@M-^\You see, I have the money‚M-^@M-^Tmainly through you‚M-^@M-^Tmy own money, I mean. I$
+feel I have a duty to my poor uncle and I could trust you to do your$
+very best. I could afford it, Timothy‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe laid her hand on his arm and$
+looked up at him almost beseechingly‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\indeed I can afford it. I have$
+more money than I shall ever spend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He patted her hand softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is just the kind of job I should like, and with$
+anybody‚M-^@M-^Ys money but yours, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd be out of the country in two shakes,$
+looking for Mr. Cartwright in the most expensive cities of the world.$
+But, my dear, I cannot accept your commission, because I know just what$
+lies behind it. You think I‚M-^@M-^Ym a restless, rather shiftless sort of$
+fellow, and you want to give me a good time‚M-^@M-^Twith your money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\thank you, but, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was disappointed and for a moment a little hurt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Would two hundred pounds‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she suggested timidly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not your two hundred,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\That lawyer of yours should take$
+better care of your money, Mary. He shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt allow you to make these$
+tempting offers to young men,‚M-^@M-^] he was smiling now. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you go abroad?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps‚M-^@M-^Tsome day,‚M-^@M-^] she said vaguely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John wanted me to go‚M-^@M-^Tand I$
+feel that I should be pleasing him. Some day, yes, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll go over at the same time as you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought of$
+taking a chance in Paris for a while‚M-^@M-^Tyou can make big money in Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In‚M-^@M-^Ta while?‚M-^@M-^] she smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a minute,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if the horse and the jockey are of$
+the same way of thinking. I know a fellow who races pretty extensively$
+in France. He has a horse called Flirt‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held out her hand for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, you‚M-^@M-^Yre incorrigible,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+She did not see him again for twelve months, not indeed until, after a$
+winter spent in Madeira, she put her foot over the gangway of the s.s.$
+_Tigilanes_ and met the quizzical smile of the youth who was waiting to$
+receive her.$
+$
+For Timothy had been in Funchal a month, seeing but unseen, since Mary$
+was generally in bed before the Casino woke up and play reached any$
+exciting level.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVI$
+$
+$
+TIMOTHY sat now on an upturned trunk, his elbows on the rails of the$
+s.s. _Tigilanes_ and his speculative eye roving the river front of$
+Liverpool.$
+$
+It was the last hour of the voyage, and Timothy, who had left Funchal$
+with four hundred pounds in his pocket-book, had exactly three genuine$
+shillings and a five-milreis piece of dubious quality.$
+$
+A man strolled along the deck and fell in at his side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cleaned you out last night, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^] he asked sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh? Oh, yes, I believe they did. That red-haired man had all the luck$
+and most of the cards.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He smiled and Timothy had a swift, happy smile that brought tired little$
+ridges under his eyes. He was not only good-looking and young, but he$
+was interesting.$
+$
+The man at his side took the cigar from his teeth and looked at it$
+before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, you know they were crooks‚M-^@M-^Tthey work this coast line$
+regularly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round, shocked and pained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say? Crooks! What, that little red-haired fellow who has been$
+trying to pick a quarrel with me all the voyage, and the tall,$
+nice-looking Englishman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His companion nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember the Captain warned us not to play cards‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They always do that to be on the safe side,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, but he was$
+obviously uneasy. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I knew they were crooks‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Knew! Good lord! Anybody will tell you. Ask the purser. Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been stung and you can do nothing. The best thing to do is to grin and$
+bear your losses. It is experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy felt the three honest shillings in his pocket and whistled$
+dismally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I were sure‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned abruptly away and raced down the main companion-way to the$
+purser‚M-^@M-^Ys little office under the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Macleod, I want to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir,‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tall pursers are a little suspicious,‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\anything wrong with$
+your bill?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No‚M-^@M-^Tnot unless his name‚M-^@M-^Ys Bill. Shall I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser opened the half-door and admitted him to the sanctuary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are two fellows aboard this packet‚M-^@M-^Ta red-haired fellow named$
+Chelwyn and a disguised duke named Brown‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you know about ‚M-^@M-^Yem?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser made a face. It was intended to convey his lack of real$
+interest in either.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll put it plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said the patient Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Are they crooks?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They play cards,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser diplomatically.$
+$
+He desired at this the eleventh hour to avoid scandal, explanations, and$
+such other phenomena which he associated in his mind with the$
+confrontation of the wise men and their dupes. That sort of thing$
+brought the Line into disrepute, and indirectly reflected upon the$
+ship‚M-^@M-^Ys officers. Besides, the ship was making port, and, like all$
+pursers, he was up to his eyes in work and frantically anxious to clear$
+it off in a minimum time so that he could take a train to his little$
+villa at Lytham, where his family was established.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mr. Anderson, if you‚M-^@M-^Yve been stung,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but the$
+captain gives fair warning the first night out of Cape Town and$
+Madeira‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys where you came aboard, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^Tand there were notices$
+posted up, both in the saloon and in the smoking-room. Have you lost$
+much?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up with some sympathy at the tall, athletic figure with the$
+tired, smiling eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I cleared up ¬£500 at the Funchal Casino,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I reckon I$
+have spent ¬£100 legitimately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The rest is gone, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, Mr. Anderson, I am$
+afraid I can do nothing. The best thing to do is to mark it down against$
+‚M-^@M-^XExperience‚M-^@M-^Y.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll forgive you for being philosophical about my losses,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you be kind enough to tell me the number of Mr. Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+cabin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two seventy-four,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\I say, Mr. Anderson, if I were you$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yd let the matter drop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you would, dear old thing,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, shaking him warmly by$
+the hand, ‚M-^@M-^\and if I were you I should let it drop too. But, as I am$
+me‚M-^@M-^T274, I think you said?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to make any trouble, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+alarmed purser. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve done our best to make you comfortable on the$
+voyage.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I did my best to pay for my ticket, so we‚M-^@M-^Yre quits,‚M-^@M-^] and with a$
+wave of his hand Timothy strode out of the cabin, dodged down past the$
+steward carrying up the luggage to the next deck, and walked swiftly$
+along the carpeted corridor till he found a little number-plate bearing$
+the figures ‚M-^@M-^\274.‚M-^@M-^] He knocked at the cabin door, and gruff voice said,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come in!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Chelwyn, the red-haired man, was in his shirt sleeves, fastening his$
+collar. Brown was sitting on the edge of his bunk, smoking a cigarette,$
+and Chelwyn, who had seen Timothy reflected in the mirror as he came in,$
+was first to recognise him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo, Mr. Anderson, do you want anything?‚M-^@M-^] he asked politely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sorry$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yve had such bad luck‚M-^@M-^Twhat the devil are you doing?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy had shut the door and slipped the bolt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I want something,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You want‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen. I thought you were playing straight, you fellows, or I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have played with you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym willing to take a chance, for that‚M-^@M-^Ys my motto$
+in life, dear lads, but there isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a chance to take when you‚M-^@M-^Yre playing$
+with crooks.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here,‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man, walking over to him and$
+emphasising his words with his forefinger against Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chest, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+kind of stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt amuse me. If you lose your money, lose it like a$
+sportsman and a gentleman, and don‚M-^@M-^Yt squeal.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Boys,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds from you, so step lively.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The suave Mr. Brown, who had been watching the scene with bored eyes,$
+stroking his drooping moustache the while, made a gentle entrance into$
+the conversation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym rather surprised, in fact, I am shocked, Mr. Anderson, that you$
+should take this line,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve lost your money fairly and$
+squarely‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys where you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy pleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling$
+you this. We‚M-^@M-^Yre very near the shore. Somewhere at the back of those$
+warehouses there‚M-^@M-^Ys certain to be a police organisation and a well-paid$
+magistrate. You are going to have a grand opportunity of appearing in$
+the respectable part of the court as a prosecutor, for I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to beat$
+you up‚M-^@M-^Tfirst you,‚M-^@M-^] he pointed to the red-haired Chelwyn, ‚M-^@M-^\and then$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre going to beat me up, are you?‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man and made$
+a quick dive.$
+$
+It was not pretty to watch, unless you took an interest in fighting.$
+They closed for a second and something jolted twice under Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw.$
+He fell back against the cabin partition. He leapt again, but Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+fist met him half-way, and he never really felt what hit him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve won this fight,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I award myself a purse of four$
+hundred pounds. Do you take any interest in these proceedings. Brown?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other man had not moved from his bunk, but now he rose and lifted$
+his dazed companion to his feet.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yd better pay this fellow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll see him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] mumbled the other, but Brown was apparently the$
+brains of the organisation and had merely mentioned his intention of$
+paying out of sheer politeness to his companion.$
+$
+He took a thick pocket-book from his hip pocket and counted out the$
+notes, and Timothy picked them up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll fix you for this,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn, mopping his bleeding lip. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+taken this from me‚M-^@M-^Tnot him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy as he unbolted the door and stepped$
+out.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Some day I‚M-^@M-^Yll get you,‚M-^@M-^] said the livid man, and the finger he pointed$
+at Timothy was shaking with anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He ascended the companion-way feeling remarkably cheerful, and met the$
+purser coming down. That officer regarded him even more suspiciously$
+than ever. But as there were no signs of the fray upon him, the purser$
+went to his cabin relieved, and Timothy passed out to relieve his$
+feelings by the side of the rail. So he sat whilst the big liner was$
+brought alongside the wharf, and then he heard his name spoken and$
+jumped up, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just wanted to tell you, Timothy, in case I did not see you on the$
+train,‚M-^@M-^] she remarked, ‚M-^@M-^\that Mrs. Renfrew has decided not to go back to$
+Bath but to go on to Paris almost immediately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good for Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Bath or Paris will find me$
+hanging around. I nearly came down to you just now to borrow my fare to$
+Bath.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice, ‚M-^@M-^\did you lose all the money you$
+won in Funchal?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy rubbed his nose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt exactly lose it,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I lent it and it has just been$
+repaid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt think it proper your travelling on the same boat.$
+She thinks you ought not to have come to Madeira after me‚M-^@M-^Tus.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was mischief in Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes, in spite of the solemnity of her$
+tone.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about what Mrs. Renfrew thinks,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Why,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre almost as badly off for cousins as I am.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As you are?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any cousins?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hundreds of ‚M-^@M-^Yem,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy glibly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who are they?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, interested.$
+$
+She had reached a stage in their friendship when his relatives were$
+immensely interesting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know their names,‚M-^@M-^] lied Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt give ‚M-^@M-^Yem names but$
+numbers‚M-^@M-^Tone, two, three, four, etc.‚M-^@M-^Tjust at that moment I was thinking$
+of number seventy-nine‚M-^@M-^Tgood morning, Mrs. Renfrew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew was severe and thin, with a yellow face and hooked nose.$
+She was a member of one of the best, if not the best, families in Bath,$
+and it was an unfailing source of pride that she did not know the people$
+that other people knew.$
+$
+Mary watched the encounter with dancing eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I have the pleasure of your company to London?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mrs.$
+Renfrew.$
+$
+She invariably made a point of leaving Mary out, and indeed sustained$
+the pleasant fiction that Mary had no existence on board the ship.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The pleasure will be mine,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I am not travelling with you$
+to London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He said this so innocently that Mrs. Renfrew was in the middle of her$
+next observation before she had any idea that the remark had an$
+offensive interpretation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You seem to have had a very unfortunate experience‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Happily a very hot-looking steward made his appearance at that moment$
+and called Mrs. Renfrew away. She gathered up her charge and with a$
+withering glance at Timothy departed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson, feeling particularly happy, was one of the$
+first to land and strolled along the quay-side waiting within view of$
+the gangway for Mary to disembark. Immediately above him towered the$
+high decks of the _Tigilanes_‚M-^@M-^Ta fact of which he was reminded when,$
+with a crash, a heavy wooden bucket dropped so close to his head that it$
+grazed his shoulder. It was a large bucket, and, dropped from that$
+height, might have caused him considerable physical distress.$
+$
+He looked up.$
+$
+The two card-players with whom he had had some argument were lolling$
+over the rail, their faces turned in quite another direction and talking$
+earnestly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hi!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+They were deaf, it appeared, for they still continued their discussion.$
+A deck hand was passing with a crate load of oranges; one fell out and$
+Timothy picked it up. The attention of Messrs. Chelwyn and Brown was$
+still directed elsewhere, and with a little swing of his arm Timothy$
+sent the orange upon its swift and unerring course. It caught the$
+red-haired man square in the side of the face and burst, and he jumped$
+round with an oath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve dropped your bucket,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sweetly. ‚M-^@M-^\Shall I throw it at$
+you or will you come down and get it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man said something violent, but his companion pulled him away, and$
+Timothy went to look for a seat with peace in his heart.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVII$
+$
+$
+THE train was crowded, but he secured a corner seat in one of the$
+cell-like compartments. It was empty when he entered, but immediately$
+after, to his surprise, Brown and Chelwyn followed him in and deposited$
+their goods upon three seats that they might in the manner of all$
+experienced travellers, occupy breathing space for three at the cost of$
+two tickets.$
+$
+They took no notice of Timothy until the train drew out and he wondered$
+what their game was. It was hardly likely that they would start any$
+rough work with him after their experience of the morning and less$
+likely because these boat trains were well policed.$
+$
+Clear of the Riverside Station the smooth Englishman leant forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you will forget and forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I have nothing to forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown with a smile, ‚M-^@M-^\is very precipitate‚M-^@M-^Twhich$
+means hasty,‚M-^@M-^] he explained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I thought it meant crooked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A spasm contorted the features of Mr. Chelwyn, but he said nothing. As$
+for Brown, he laughed. He laughed heartily but spuriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys not a bad joke,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but to tell you the truth, we mistook$
+you for‚M-^@M-^Tone of us, and my friend and I thought it would be a good joke$
+to get the better of you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was and it wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown, not easily nonplussed. ‚M-^@M-^\Of$
+course, we intended restoring the money to you before you left the$
+ship.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Naturally,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I never thought you would do anything else.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Only you know you rather spoilt our little _esprit_.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If the conversation is to develop in a foreign language,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would only remark: _Honi soit qui mal y pense_,‚M-^@M-^] and the polite Mr.$
+Brown laughed again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You do not mind if my friend and I have a little quiet game by$
+ourselves, if,‚M-^@M-^] he said humorously, ‚M-^@M-^\we swindle one another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I have no objection to watching, but if,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\you should suddenly draw my attention whilst your$
+friend‚M-^@M-^Ys head is turned, to the ease with which I could win a hundred$
+pounds by picking the lady, or discovering the little pea under the$
+little shell, or show me a way of getting rich from any of the other$
+devices which the children of the public schools find so alluring at the$
+country fair, I shall be under the painful necessity of slapping you$
+violently on the wrist.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Thereafter the conversation languished until the train had run through$
+Crewe and was approaching Rugby. It was here that Mr. Brown stopped in$
+the midst of a long, learned discussion on English politics to offer his$
+cigarette-case to Timothy. Timothy chose a cigarette and put it in his$
+pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one of the best Egyptian brands made,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown casually.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Best for you or best for me?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] It was the red-haired Chelwyn who addressed him for the first$
+time. ‚M-^@M-^\What have you to be afraid of? You‚M-^@M-^Yre as scared as a cat! Do you$
+think we want to poison you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Brown produced a flask and poured a modicum of whisky into the cup$
+and handed it to his companion, then he drank himself. Then, without$
+invitation he poured a little more into the cup and offered it to$
+Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let bygones be bygones,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no desire to be a bygone,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I would much rather be$
+a herenow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Nevertheless, he took the cup and smelt it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Butyl chloride,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\has a distinctive odour. I suppose you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+call it by its technical name, and to you it is just vulgarly ‚M-^@M-^Xa$
+knock-out drop.‚M-^@M-^Y Really,‚M-^@M-^] he said, handing back the cup, ‚M-^@M-^\you boys are$
+so elementary. Where did you learn it all‚M-^@M-^Tfrom the movies?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The red-haired man half rose from his seat with a growl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply, and with a jerk of his hand he flung$
+open the carriage door.$
+$
+The men shrank back at the sight of the rapidly running line, and at the$
+certainty of death which awaited any who left the train on that side of$
+the carriage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Start something,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yll undertake to put either one$
+or both of you on to the line. We‚M-^@M-^Yre going at about sixty miles an hour,$
+and a fellow that went out there wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be taking a chance. Now is$
+there going to be a rough house?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Close the door, close the door,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown nervously. ‚M-^@M-^\What a$
+stupid idea, Mr. Anderson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy swung the door to and the man moved up towards him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym just going to put it to you plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said Brown. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve made$
+the voyage out to the Cape and the voyage back and the only mug we met$
+was you. What we won from you just about paid our expenses, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+putting it to you, as a sportsman and a gentleman, that you should let$
+us have half of that stuff back.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The sportsman in me admires your nerve,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I suppose$
+it is the gentleman part that returns an indignant ‚M-^@M-^XNo!‚M-^@M-^Y to your$
+interesting observation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brown turned to his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, that‚M-^@M-^Ys that, Len,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yll just have to let the money$
+go. It is a pity,‚M-^@M-^] he said wistfully and his companion grunted.$
+$
+That ended the conversation so far as the journey was concerned, and$
+Timothy heard no more until he was in the gloomy courtyard at Euston$
+Station and stepping into his taxi.$
+$
+To his surprise it was the red-haired man who approached him, and$
+something in his manner prevented Timothy from taking the action which$
+he otherwise would have thought necessary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here, young fellow,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you watch Brown‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys wild.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not exactly tame,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt take any notice of me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man a little bitterly. ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+engaged in the rough work. I should have got two hundred out of your$
+money‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys what made me so wild. Brown paid all my expenses and gives$
+me ten pound a week and a commission. It sounds funny to you, doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it, but it is the truth,‚M-^@M-^] and somehow Timothy knew that the man was not$
+lying.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys finished with me‚M-^@M-^Tsays I am a hoodoo,‚M-^@M-^] said the little man. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve got out of five weeks‚M-^@M-^Y work? Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand and disclosed two ten-pound notes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys dangerous,‚M-^@M-^] he warned Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you make any mistake$
+about that. I was only wild because I was losing my money, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys wild$
+because you‚M-^@M-^Yve got fresh with him and caught him out every time. Good$
+night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He felt in his pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying, it is a plausible lie and one that pleases me,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\This will salve my conscience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped two notes into the man‚M-^@M-^Ys hands.$
+$
+Chelwyn was speechless for a moment. Then he asked:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And where are you staying in London, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel,‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll remember that. I$
+shall hear if anything is going on and I‚M-^@M-^Yll ‚M-^@M-^Yphone you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+gentleman, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So Mr. Brown said,‚M-^@M-^] remarked Timothy and drove off, feeling unusually$
+cheerful.$
+$
+If Timothy could be cheerful under the depressing conditions which$
+prevailed on the night of his arrival in London, he was a veritable$
+pattern of cheer. A drizzling rain was falling as the taxi squeaked its$
+way through a labyrinth of mean streets. He had glimpses of$
+wretched-looking people, grotesque of shape and unreal, through the$
+rain-blurred window of the cab.$
+$
+Then suddenly the character of the streets changed, and he was in a$
+broad street twinkling with light. There was a glimpse of trees, wide$
+open spaces, dotted with light. The street grew busier and the traffic$
+thicker, then suddenly the cab turned again into semi-darkness and$
+pulled up before the hotel.$
+$
+A porter opened the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do I think of Madeira?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy of the astonished man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had time to think. Will I be staying long in London? No. What$
+are my opinions of the political crisis which has arisen in my absence?$
+I would rather not say.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It takes a great deal to upset the equilibrium of a well-conducted hall$
+man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you booked your room?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Timothy meekly admitted that he had.$
+$
+He woke to a London much more beautiful, to a vista of old-world$
+buildings such as Cruikshank loved to draw, to a green square and$
+glimpses of greener trees.$
+$
+Mary was staying at the Carlton, but he had arranged to meet her for$
+lunch. He had not arranged to meet her dragon, but he knew she would be$
+there. He had breakfasted, and was on the point of leaving the hotel,$
+when Chelwyn came.$
+$
+To say that Timothy regretted his generosity of the night before would$
+be to do him an injustice. Nevertheless, he had some misgivings as to$
+whether he had not been a little too generous. The appearance of Mr.$
+Chelwyn, early in the morning, looking so spruce and confident, was in$
+itself a suspicious happening, though events proved that the suspicion$
+was unfounded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you alone for a moment, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^] asked the red-haired$
+man.$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come along to the drawing-room,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+It was the one public room which would be empty at that time of the$
+morning. Mr. Chelwyn deposited his hat and stick and brand-new yellow$
+gloves before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mr. Anderson, I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell you a few facts which will$
+surprise you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had a gold brick sent to you by your Uncle George in$
+Alaska, have you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy dubiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Because I‚M-^@M-^Ym not buying that$
+kind of fact.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man smiled and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is hardly likely I should try that stuff on you, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No,$
+this is a much more serious matter. Before I go any farther I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell$
+you that I am not asking for money. I am grateful to you for what you$
+did to me last night, Mr. Anderson. A crook has a wife and children the$
+same as anybody else. I have been in this funny business for ten years,$
+but now I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of it for good.‚M-^@M-^] He looked round and dropped his voice,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson, I told you last night that we‚M-^@M-^Yve been five or six weeks$
+away from England. Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt that sound strange to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is because you don‚M-^@M-^Yt know the game,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\As a rule,$
+when we‚M-^@M-^Yre working these liners, we go out to Cape Town and come back by$
+the next ship that sails. What do you think we stayed at Funchal$
+for‚M-^@M-^Tthere‚M-^@M-^Ys no money in short voyages‚M-^@M-^Tit‚M-^@M-^Ys all on the long run from$
+Madeira to Cape Town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt the slightest idea,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy wearily. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt even$
+remember seeing you in Funchal‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We laid low,‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That may be, but if you‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell me the interesting story of$
+your life, Ginger, I beg that you will cut it short‚M-^@M-^Tthe history, I$
+mean, not necessarily your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell it to you as quickly as possible,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt always work with Brown. In fact, I‚M-^@M-^Yve only worked with him about$
+three times before. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man with the broads‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The broads?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\With the cards,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I say that I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man$
+with the broads as some of the others. I‚M-^@M-^Yve got a bit of a reputation$
+for scrapping. I‚M-^@M-^Yve never left a pal in the lurch and I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been$
+ready for any ‚M-^@M-^Xrough house‚M-^@M-^Y that came along. About two months ago Brown$
+sent for me‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got a flat off Piccadilly and lives like a lord. He$
+told me he was going to Madeira on a special job, that he‚M-^@M-^Yd been$
+employed by a lady in Paris‚M-^@M-^Ta Madame Serpilot (you‚M-^@M-^Yd better write that$
+down in your pocket-book)‚M-^@M-^Tto shepherd a young lady who was coming over.$
+Mind you, there was no harm intended to the young lady, but the general$
+idea was that she might be accompanied by a man, and he was the fellow$
+who had to be looked after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was the lady‚M-^@M-^Ys name?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man without hesitation, ‚M-^@M-^\and you were the fellow$
+we were asked to put out of business. Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys idea was to break you;$
+then, when you got to London, one of his pals would have met you and$
+offered to lend you money. They‚M-^@M-^Yd have framed up a charge against you of$
+obtaining money by false pretences, and you would have been pinched.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys eyebrows rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Was this Mrs. Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys plan?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, but the man shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir, she gave just the details to Brown. She never said what was to$
+be done to you, according to him, but you were to be stopped going$
+around with the young lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you‚M-^@M-^Yve got me,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe she‚M-^@M-^Ys an old widow, but$
+Brown never told me much about her. He got instructions from her while$
+he was in Paris, but I never discovered how. I went to Madeira with him$
+because he knew I was tough‚M-^@M-^Tbut I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt tough enough,‚M-^@M-^] he added with a$
+dry smile.$
+$
+Timothy held out his hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ginger,‚M-^@M-^] he said solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\please forgive the orange!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mind that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\that‚M-^@M-^Ys all in the day‚M-^@M-^Ys work.$
+It made me a bit wild, and my eye‚M-^@M-^Ys feeling sore, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that$
+worry you. What you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to do now is to look out for Brown, because$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll have you as sure as death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll look out for Madame Serpilot, too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I think I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+to Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys not in Paris now, I can tell you that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\The wire$
+Brown got at Liverpool was from Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\is even more attractive than Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                             CHAPTER XVIII$
+$
+$
+CHELWYN left Timothy with something to think about. Who was Madame$
+Serpilot, this old lady who had such an interest in Mary travelling$
+alone? And why, oh! why had she left Paris for Monte Carlo at the fag$
+end of the season? For he and Mary had privately decided between them$
+that London and Paris should only be stopping places on the route to the$
+Riviera. Why should Madame Serpilot have changed her plans at the same$
+time? There was something more than a coincidence in this. At lunch-time$
+he had Mary to herself, her chaperon having a headache.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\can you tell me why we changed our plans on the boat$
+and decided to go straight on to Monte Carlo instead of staying in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said readily. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember my telling you about those$
+beautiful books of views that I saw on the ship?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where did you see them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I found them in my cabin one day. I think the steward must have left$
+them,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\They were most wonderful productions, full of coloured$
+prints and photographs‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt I tell you about them?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I remember,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\Found them in your cabin, eh? Well,$
+nobody left any beautiful or attractive pictures of Monte Carlo in my$
+berth, but I think that won‚M-^@M-^Yt stop me going on to Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was an opportunity she had been seeking for a week and she seized it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want to ask you something, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew told me$
+the other day that they call you ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson. Why is that,$
+Timothy?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because I take a chance, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been taking$
+chances all my life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not a gambler, Timothy, are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked gravely. ‚M-^@M-^\I know you$
+bet and play cards, but men do that for amusement, and somehow it is all$
+right. But when men start out to make a living, and actually make a$
+living, by games of chance, they somehow belong to another life and$
+another people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was silent.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre just too good to go that way, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she went on. ‚M-^@M-^\There are$
+lots of chances that a man can take in this world, in matching his$
+brains, his strength and his skill against other men, and when he wins$
+his stake is safe. He doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose it the next day or the next month,$
+and he‚M-^@M-^Ys picking winners all the time, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His first inclination was to be nettled. She was wounding the tender$
+skin of his vanity, and he was startled to discover how tender a skin$
+that was. All that she said was true and less than true. She could not$
+guess how far his mind and inclination were from commonplace labour and$
+how very little work came into the calculations of his future. He looked$
+upon a job as a thing not to be held and developed into something$
+better, but as a stopgap between two successful chances. He was almost$
+shocked when this truth came home to him. The girl was nervous, and$
+painfully anxious not to hurt him, and yet well aware that she was$
+rubbing a sore place.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, for your sake, as well as for mine, for you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of$
+mine, I want to be proud of you, to see you past this present phase of$
+life. Mrs. Renfrew speaks of you as a gambler, and says your name, even$
+at your age, is well known as one who would rather bet than buy. That$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt true, Timothy, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She put her hand on his and looked into his face. He did not meet her$
+eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that is true, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said steadily. ‚M-^@M-^\How it comes to be$
+true, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite know. I suppose I have drifted a little over the$
+line, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym grateful to you for pulling me up. Oh, no, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt regret$
+the past‚M-^@M-^Tit has all been useful‚M-^@M-^Tand I have made good on chances, but I$
+see there are other chances that a man can take than putting his money$
+on the pace of a horse or backing against zero. Maybe, when I get back$
+to London I‚M-^@M-^Yll settle down into a respectable citizen and keep hens or$
+something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was speaking seriously, though at first she thought he was being$
+sarcastic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you won‚M-^@M-^Yt gamble again?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He hesitated to reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I mean it isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair of me to ask$
+you. It is almost cruel,‚M-^@M-^] she smiled, ‚M-^@M-^\to let you go to Monte Carlo and$
+ask you not to put money on the tables. But promise me, Timothy, that$
+when I tell you to stop playing, you will stop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here‚M-^@M-^Ys my hand on it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, brightening up already at the$
+prospect of being allowed to gamble at all. ‚M-^@M-^\Hereafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He raised$
+his hand solemnly. ‚M-^@M-^\By the way,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, ‚M-^@M-^\do you know a lady named$
+Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I do not,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have never heard the name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have no relations or friends in France?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] she replied immediately.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What made you go to France at all?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\When I heard from you,$
+Mary, you talked about taking a holiday in Madeira before setting up$
+house in Bath, and the first thing I knew of your intention to go abroad$
+again was the letter you sent me just before I started for Madeira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wanted to go a year ago, after Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\then$
+Mrs. Renfrew couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt take the trip‚M-^@M-^Tone of her younger children had$
+measles.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has that woman children?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in an awed voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be absurd. Of course she has children. It was she who decided on$
+making the trip. She writes little articles in the _Bath County$
+Herald_‚M-^@M-^Ta local paper‚M-^@M-^Ton the care of children and all that sort of$
+thing. She‚M-^@M-^Ys not really a journalist, she is literary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\sometimes they write poetry, sometimes recipes$
+for ice cream‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xtake three cups of flour, a pint of cream in which an$
+egg has been boiled and a pinch of vanilla‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled. Evidently Timothy had hit upon the particular brand of$
+journalism to which Mrs. Renfrew was addicted.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\there was to have been a sort of Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Welfare Meeting in Paris next week‚M-^@M-^Tan International affair‚M-^@M-^Tand when we$
+were in Madeira she received an invitation to attend with a free return$
+ticket‚M-^@M-^Twasn‚M-^@M-^Yt that splendid?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Splendid,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy absently. ‚M-^@M-^\Naturally you thought it was an$
+excellent opportunity to go also.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And now you have arrived here you find that the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Meeting has been postponed for ten years?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you know that the meeting had been postponed?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I guessed it,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\such things have happened before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The truth is,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\nobody knows anything about this$
+meeting, and the letter which Mrs. Renfrew sent to the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Society in Paris was waiting for us when we arrived at the Carlton. It$
+had been returned‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XAddressee Unknown.‚M-^@M-^Y Mrs. Renfrew had put the Carlton$
+address inside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was ample excuse for speculation of an innocuous kind. Mrs. Renfrew$
+had been approached because it was known by this mysterious somebody$
+that she would take the girl with her, and this sinister somebody had$
+hired two thugs to shepherd her from Madeira and to put Timothy out of$
+action, should he decide to accompany the party to France. The situation$
+was distinctly interesting.$
+$
+Three days later the party crossed the Channel. Timothy had high hopes$
+of adventure, which were fated to be more than fulfilled. They stayed$
+three days in Paris and he had the time of his life. He went to the$
+races at Maisons Lafitte, and came back glowing with a sense of his$
+virtue, for he had not made a bet. He drifted in to the baccara rooms at$
+Enghien, watched tens of thousands of francs change hands, and returned$
+to Paris that night with a halo fitted by Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys own hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre really wonderful, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you are$
+allowed one final flutter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym saving that up for Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+Since his arrival in Paris he had lost the right to his name, for he was$
+taking no chances. If he went abroad at night he kept to the brilliantly$
+illuminated boulevards or the crowded caf√©s. He kept clear of the$
+crowds‚M-^@M-^Tespecially crowds which formed quickly and for no apparent$
+reason.$
+$
+He was taking no chances because he felt it was not fair upon the$
+particular genius who presided over his destinies that he should$
+squander his luck in a miraculous escape from death or disablement. Only$
+once, when dining at the Scribe, did he think he saw the familiar face$
+of Mr. Brown. With an apology he left the two ladies and made his way$
+with difficulty through the crowded restaurant, only to find that his$
+man had disappeared.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\These caf√©s have as many doors as a trick-scene,‚M-^@M-^] he grumbled when he$
+came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you see a friend of yours?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not so much a friend as one who has a financial interest in me,‚M-^@M-^]$
+replied Timothy.$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew had thawed a little under the beneficent influences of$
+Paris. She was busy sending off picture-postcards and had written to$
+Bath her first impression of the French capital to the extent of three$
+columns. She had also written a poem which began: ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, city of light$
+that shines so bright,‚M-^@M-^] and went on rhyming ‚M-^@M-^\vain‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\Seine,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\gay‚M-^@M-^]$
+with ‚M-^@M-^\play,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\joy‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\alloy,‚M-^@M-^] through twenty-three stanzas.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I rather pride myself,‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew, ‚M-^@M-^\upon that description of$
+Paris‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xthe city of light.‚M-^@M-^Y Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think it is very original, Mr.$
+Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically. ‚M-^@M-^\Parisians have called it the$
+‚M-^@M-^XVille Lumi√®re‚M-^@M-^Y for about two hundred years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys almost the same, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew. ‚M-^@M-^\How clever the$
+French are!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew did not speak French and took a more generous view of the$
+young man when she discovered that he did. It fell to Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys lot to$
+order tickets, arrange cabs, pay bills and act as unofficial courier to$
+the party. He was anxious to be gone from Paris, impatient for the big$
+game to begin. For some reason, he did not anticipate that any harm$
+would come to the girl. This struck him as strange later, but at the$
+moment all his thoughts were centred upon the match between himself and$
+this old French lady who had set herself out to separate him from Mary$
+Maxell.$
+$
+No unpleasant incident‚M-^@M-^Tthe crowded condition of the dining-car$
+excepted‚M-^@M-^Tmarred the journey to Monte Carlo. There was the inevitable$
+night spent in a stuffy sleeping-berth in a car that rocked and swayed$
+to such an extent that Timothy expected it to jump the line, as$
+thousands of other passengers have expected it to do; and they came with$
+the morning to the Valley of the Rhone, a wide, blue, white-flecked$
+stream flowing between gaunt hills, past solitary ch√¢teaux and strange$
+walled towns, which looked as if they had been kept under glass cases$
+for centuries, that the modern world should be reminded of the dangers$
+under which our forefathers lived. So to Marseilles, and a long, hot and$
+slow journey to Nice.$
+$
+To the girl it was a pilgrimage of joy. She would not have missed a$
+single moment of that ride. The blue sea, the white villas with their$
+green jalousies, the banked roses over wall and pergola and the$
+warm-scented breeze, and above all the semi-tropical sun, placed her in$
+a new world, a wonder world more beautiful than imagination had painted.$
+$
+There is something about Monte Carlo which is very satisfying. It is so$
+orderly, so clean, so white and bright, that you have the impression$
+that it is carefully dusted every morning and that the villas on the$
+hills are taken down weekly by tender hands, polished and replaced.$
+$
+There is nothing garish about Monte Carlo, for all its stucco and$
+plaster. Some of the buildings, and particularly the Casino, were$
+compared by the irreverent Timothy to the White City, but it was a$
+refined White City and the Casino itself, with its glass-roofed porch,$
+its great, solemn hanging lamps and its decorous uniformed attendants,$
+had something of the air of a National Bank.$
+$
+Timothy took a room at the H√¥tel de Paris, where the girl was staying,$
+and lost no time in seeking information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge. ‚M-^@M-^\There is a madame who bears that$
+name, I think, but she is not staying here, monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of whom should I inquire, I pray you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in the vernacular.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of the Municipal Council, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge, ‚M-^@M-^\or, if the$
+madame is a wealthy madame, of the manager of the Credit Lyonnais, who$
+will perhaps inform monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thanks many times,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He went first to the Credit Lyonnais, and found the manager extremely$
+polite but uncommunicative. It was not the practice of the bank, he$
+said, to disclose the addresses of their clients. He would not say that$
+Madame Serpilot was his client, but if she were, he could certainly not$
+give her address to any unauthorised person. From this Timothy gathered$
+that Madame Serpilot was a client. He went on to the Mairie and met with$
+better fortune. The Mairie had no respect for persons. It was there to$
+supply information and what the Mairie of Monte Carlo does not know$
+about Monaco, the cleverest detective force in the world would be$
+wasting its time trying to discover.$
+$
+Madame Serpilot lived at the Villa Condamine. The Villa Condamine was$
+not, as the name suggested, in the poorer part of Monte Carlo but in$
+that most exclusive territory, the tiny peninsula of Cap Martin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has madam been a resident long?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For one hundred and twenty-nine days,‚M-^@M-^] replied the official promptly.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame hired the villa furnished from the agent, of the Grand Duchess$
+Eleana who, alas! was destroyed in that terrible revolution.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He gave Timothy some details of the family from which the Grand Duchess$
+had sprung, the amount of her income in pre-war days, and was passing to$
+her eccentricities when Timothy took his departure. He was not$
+interested in the Grand Duchess Eleana, alive or dead.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIX$
+$
+$
+HE went to the house agent on the main street and from him procured$
+the exact position of Madame Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys residence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\An old madame?‚M-^@M-^] said the agent. ‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur, I cannot say that she is$
+old. And I cannot say that she is young.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He thought a moment, as though endeavouring to find some reason for this$
+reticence on the subject of her age, and then added:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have not seen her. Madame is a widow,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Alas! there are$
+so many in France as the result of the terrible war.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then she is young,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\They didn‚M-^@M-^Yt send old men to the$
+front.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may be young,‚M-^@M-^] replied the agent, ‚M-^@M-^\or she may be old. One does not$
+know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the assistant who had shown the lady the house and had taken$
+the documents for her to sign. The assistant was aged sixteen, and at$
+the age of sixteen most people above twenty are listed amongst the aged.$
+He was certain she was a widow and very feeble, because she walked with$
+a stick. She always wore a heavy black veil, even when she was in the$
+garden.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it not natural,‚M-^@M-^] said the house agent romantically, ‚M-^@M-^\that the madame$
+who has lost all that makes life worth living should no longer desire$
+the world to look upon her face?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It may be natural in Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not natural$
+in London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He located the house on a large plan which the obliging agent produced,$
+and went back to the hotel, firmly resolved to take the first$
+opportunity of calling on Madame Serpilot and discovering what object$
+she had in view when she arranged to endanger his young life.$
+$
+Mary was waiting for him, a little impatiently for one who had such a$
+horror of gambling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have to get tickets at the Bureau,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\and the concierge$
+says we must have special membership cards for the Cercle Priv√©e.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The tickets were easy to procure, and they passed into the great saloon$
+where, around five tables, stood silent ovals of humanity. The scene was$
+a weird one to Timothy and fascinating too. Besides this, all the other$
+gambling games in the world, all the roulette tables and baccara$
+outfits, were crude and amateurish. The eight croupiers who sat at each$
+table in their black frock coats and their black ties, solemn visaged,$
+unemotional, might have been deacons in committee. The click of rakes$
+against chips, the whirr of the twirling ball, the monotonous sing-song$
+announcement of the chief croupier‚M-^@M-^Tit was a ritual and a business at$
+one and the same time.$
+$
+It was amazing to reflect that, year in and year out, from ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock$
+in the morning until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock at night (until midnight in the Cercle$
+Priv√©e) these black-coated men sat at their tables, twirling their$
+rakes, watching without error every note or counter that fell on the$
+table, separating notes from chips with a deftness that was amazing,$
+doing this in such an atmosphere of respectability that the most rabid$
+anti-gambler watching the scene must come in time to believe that$
+roulette was a legitimate business exercise.$
+$
+Through the years this fringe of people about the table would remain,$
+though units would go out, and as units went out new units would replace$
+them, and everlastingly would sit shabby old men and women with their$
+cryptic notebooks, making their tableaux with red and black pencils,$
+religiously recording the result of every coup, staking now and again$
+their five-franc pieces, and watching them raked to the croupier with$
+stony despair or drawing with trembling hands the few poor francs which$
+fortune had sent them.$
+$
+Timothy was very silent when they passed the portals of the Cercle$
+Priv√©e, into that wonderful interior which, viewed from the entrance$
+room, had the appearance of some rich cathedral.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you think of them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mary.$
+$
+He did not answer at once.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did you think of the people?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded again. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you see$
+that quaint old woman‚M-^@M-^Ttaking a chance? I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+really didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and sighed.$
+$
+The roulette table did not attract him. He strolled off to watch the$
+players at _trente et quarante_. Here the procedure was more$
+complicated. One of the officials dealt two lines of cards, ending each$
+when the pips added to something over thirty. The top line stood for$
+black, the lower line for red, and that which was nearest to thirty won.$
+After mastering this, the process was simple; you could either back the$
+red or the black, or you could bet that the first card that was dealt$
+was identical with the colour that won, or was the reverse.$
+$
+The game interested him. It had certain features which in a way were$
+fascinating. He noticed that the croupier never spoke of the black. The$
+black might have had no existence at the _trente et quarante_ table;$
+either ‚M-^@M-^\red won‚M-^@M-^] or ‚M-^@M-^\red lost.‚M-^@M-^] He staked a louis and won twice. He$
+staked another and lost it. Then he won three coups of a louis and$
+looked around uncertainly, almost guiltily, for Mary.$
+$
+She was watching the roulette players, and Timothy took a wad of bills$
+from his pocket and counted out six milles. That was another thing he$
+was to discover: there were three classes of players‚M-^@M-^Tthose who punted$
+in one or five louis pieces, those who bet handsomely in milles (a$
+thousand-franc note is a ‚M-^@M-^\mille‚M-^@M-^] and has no other name), and those who$
+went the maximum of twelve thousand francs on each coup.$
+$
+Money had no value. He threw six thousand down to the croupier and$
+received in exchange six oblong plaques like thin cakes of blue soap. He$
+put a thousand francs on the black and lost it. He looked round$
+apprehensively for Mary, but she was still intent upon the roulette$
+players. He ventured another thousand, and lost that too. A young$
+Englishman sitting at the table looked up with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre betting against the tableau,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The table is running red$
+to-night. Look!‚M-^@M-^] He showed a little notebook ruled into divisions, and$
+long lines of dots, one under the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all these$
+are reds. The table has only swung across to black twice for any run,$
+and then it was only a run of four. If you bet against the table you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+go broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At any other place than at the tables at Monte Carlo advice of this$
+character, and intimate references to financial possibilities, would be$
+resented. But the Rooms, like the grave, level all the players, who are$
+a great family banded together in an unrecognised brotherhood for the$
+destruction of a common enemy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance against the table,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I shall go$
+broke, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman laughed.$
+$
+The four thousand francs he had left went the same way as their friends$
+and Timothy changed another six thousand and threw two on the black.$
+Then, acting on the impulse of the moment, he threw down the remaining$
+four.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned at the shocked voice and Mary was standing behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you gamble like that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He tried to smile, but produced a grimace.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, it is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is only francs, and francs aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+real money, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She turned and walked away and he followed. The Englishman, twisting$
+round in his chair, said something. Timothy thought he was asking$
+whether he should look after his money and answered ‚M-^@M-^\Certainly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl walked to one of the padded benches by the wall and sat down.$
+There was such real trouble in her face that Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys heart sank.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is my last fling and you told me I$
+could have it. After to-night I cut out everything that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt qualify$
+for the ‚M-^@M-^Xearned income‚M-^@M-^Y column of the tax-surveyor.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt the amount of money you were$
+venturing, but there was something in your face which made me feel‚M-^@M-^Twhy!$
+I just felt sick,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary!‚M-^@M-^] he said in surprise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know I‚M-^@M-^Ym being unreasonable,‚M-^@M-^] she interrupted, ‚M-^@M-^\but Timothy, I‚M-^@M-^TI$
+just don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to think of you like this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked into his dejected face and the softest light that ever shone$
+in woman‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes was in hers.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said, half in jest, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yre paying the penalty for$
+having a girl friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying the penalty for being a loafer,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily. ‚M-^@M-^\I think$
+there must be some bad blood in us. Mary, I know what I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and took one of her hands. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing the right to love you,$
+dearest.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a queer place for such a confession, and in her wildest dreams$
+the girl never imagined that the first word of love spoken to her by any$
+man would come in a gambling saloon at Monte Carlo. Above her where she$
+sat was the great canvas of the Florentine Graces; half nude reliefs on$
+the ceiling dangled glittering chains of light and over all sounded the$
+monotonous voice of the croupier:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tet couleur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The young Englishman at the table turned round with an inquiring lift of$
+his eyebrows, and Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wants to know if I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and honestly$
+Mary, I am. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going back to London when this trip‚M-^@M-^Ys over, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going to start at the bottom and work up.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to lie to you, or pretend any longer. I just love you,$
+Mary, and if you‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for me, I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good. I have been a gambler,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\a poor, low gambler, and all the time I‚M-^@M-^Yve thought I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+clever! I‚M-^@M-^Yve been going round puffed up with my own self-importance, and$
+my head‚M-^@M-^Ys been so much in the air that I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt seen just where my feet$
+were leading me,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\This sounds like the sort of thing you$
+get at the Salvation Army penitent form,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I‚M-^@M-^Ym straight and$
+sincere.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you are, Timothy, but you needn‚M-^@M-^Yt start at the bottom. I have my$
+money‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop where you are, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\Not a penny would I take$
+from you, darling.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did they ring that bell for?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+It was the second time the tinkle of sound had come from the croupier at$
+the _trente et quarante_ table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Heaven knows!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe it is to call the other$
+worshippers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the young Englishman looked round and said something.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he say?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He said seventeen,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Was that the number you backed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no numbers on that table except No. 1‚M-^@M-^Tand No. 1 is the fat$
+man with the rake‚M-^@M-^The gets it coming and going. Mary, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to ask$
+you one question: If I make good will you marry me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was silent and again the voice of the croupier came:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tcouleur gagne.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What does ‚M-^@M-^Xrouge perd‚M-^@M-^Y mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked. ‚M-^@M-^\He has said that ever so many$
+times.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means ‚M-^@M-^Xblack wins,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does black always win?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not always,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe he‚M-^@M-^Ys only saying that to lure$
+me back to the table. Mary, what do you say?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and to the scandal of the one attendant who was$
+watching them he bent forward and kissed her.$
+$
+A terrible act this, for the gold-laced and liveried footman, who came$
+with slow, majestic steps to where they sat.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\this is not done.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked up at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Chassez-vous_,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly.$
+$
+It was startling French, but it was the nearest he could get at the$
+moment to ‚M-^@M-^\chase yourself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the bell tinkled, and the young Englishman rose, thrust a small$
+packet of money into his pocket and came toward them, bearing what$
+looked to be a large book without covers. His face was a little haggard$
+and the perspiration stood upon his forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is getting on my nerves, old man. You had better play yourself,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, and he handed the book to Timothy, and Timothy looked vaguely$
+from his hands to the hot Englishman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys this?‚M-^@M-^] he croaked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A run of twenty-eight on the black,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+phenomenal! You wanted me to go on, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you? I asked you whether I$
+should play your thousand francs. The bank bust four times‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+hear them ring for more money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded. He had no words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, your six went to twelve and I left the maximum run,‚M-^@M-^] the$
+Englishman said. ‚M-^@M-^\I asked you if that was right and you nodded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I nodded,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy mechanically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve won twenty-seven and a half maximums.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at the money in his hand, looked up at the ceiling and$
+gulped something down.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] he gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\I am obliged to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was inadequate, but it was all that he could say.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\I won a lot of money myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a great hand at arithmetic,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\will you tell me$
+how many pounds twenty-seven and a half maximums make?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a remarkable situation. Somebody should have laughed, but they$
+were all too serious, the girl as serious as Timothy, and the young$
+Englishman scrawling calculations on a loose page of his notebook.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thirty-five francs to a pound,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\makes ¬£340 a coup.$
+Twenty-seven and a half is about‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and he gripped the other‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and wrung it.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you, fairy godmother‚M-^@M-^TI don‚M-^@M-^Yt know your other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They stood together watching his lanky figure, as he, wholly unconscious$
+of the providential part he had played, moved down to the roulette$
+table, eyeing the game with the air of superiority which every player of$
+_trente et quarante_ has for a game with a paltry maximum of six$
+thousand francs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] whispered the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it wonderful?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He put the money into his pocket and it bulged untidily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do with it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Give it to the poor,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, taking her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the poor?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was wondering whether his fortune had driven him mad.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The poor,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly, ‚M-^@M-^\money won by gambling‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense,‚M-^@M-^] she broke in, ‚M-^@M-^\to what poor are you giving it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To poor Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] said he. ‚M-^@M-^\Let us dash madly to the bar and drink$
+orangeade.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XX$
+$
+$
+THE band was playing one of de Courville‚M-^@M-^Ys new revue tunes, and the$
+Caf√© de Paris was crowded out. There had been a big influx of visitors$
+from Nice, and Monte Carlo presented an appearance comparable with the$
+height of the season. Mrs. Renfrew had motored up to La Turbie, and a$
+bank of cloud having descended upon the mountain made the road$
+dangerous. (Those who have journeyed from the Corniche to Monte Carlo by$
+night will appreciate just how dangerous is that road.) She had,$
+therefore, elected to spend the night at the hotel on the top of the$
+hill.$
+$
+This information she had telephoned to the girl on the night following$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys great win, and had added that she could see ‚M-^@M-^\the twinkling$
+lights of Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^] and that ‚M-^@M-^\the misty spaces of ocean filled her$
+with strange unrest,‚M-^@M-^] which observation had been repeated to the$
+unsympathetic Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It must be awful to have a mind like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and then, ‚M-^@M-^\Mary,$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve been a long time waiting to exchange confidences about cousins.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no confidences to give you about Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary with a$
+smile, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have been on the point of telling me about your cousin$
+so often that I feel a little curious.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The story he had to tell was not a nice one. It meant opening old wounds$
+and reviving sad memories, but it had to be done. She was not so shocked$
+as he had expected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have not told me anything new,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\You see, all$
+along I have known that the ‚M-^@M-^XA.C.‚M-^@M-^Y in your name stood for ‚M-^@M-^XAlfred$
+Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^Y and once uncle told me that he had known a relative of$
+yours, and I guessed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly she demanded:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think Cartwright is in Europe?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am certain. That is, if Morocco is in Europe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have had$
+it in the back of my mind ever since the crime was committed that that$
+is the place he would make for. You see, in the few minutes I had with$
+him he told me, perhaps not the whole of the story, but at any rate his$
+version. He knows Morocco and has been there before. He spoke about a$
+Moorish chief named El Mograb, who wanted him to stay with the tribe,$
+and he told me he was sorry he had not followed the Moor‚M-^@M-^Ys advice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell the police that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did not tell the police very much about that visit. Cartwright$
+revived his accusations against Sir John. It meant digging up these$
+charges, and that is what I did not wish to do, for‚M-^@M-^Tfor‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For my sake?‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys about the size of it,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+A little stream of diners were leaving the restaurant, moving slowly$
+down the narrow aisle between the tables, and Timothy stopped talking as$
+they passed and eyed them with a bored interest usual to the$
+circumstances.$
+$
+It was after the interruption had ended, and the last of the little$
+stream had departed, that he saw the card on the table. It was near his$
+place and it had not been there before. He picked it up and on the$
+uppermost side was written: ‚M-^@M-^\Do not let your friend see this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began, and turned the card over.$
+$
+It was not written but printed in capital letters:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM ME BY THE TWENTY-NINTH, I BEG OF YOU$
+    THAT YOU WILL GO TO TANGIER AND ENQUIRE AT THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL$
+    FOR A MAN CALLED RAHBAT‚M-^@M-^TA MOOR, WHO WILL LEAD YOU TO ME. I BEG$
+    YOU FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO COME. DID YOU GET THE$
+    MONEY?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy laid the card down and stared at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and reached out her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Tit is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense, Timothy. What is it? Let me see it, please.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Without a word he handed the card to the girl, who read it through in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is that from?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, ‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Obviously,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the reference to the money and the appeal to our$
+relationship‚M-^@M-^Tbut how did it get there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the head waiter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who were those people who went out just now?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They are very well known,‚M-^@M-^] explained the head waiter. ‚M-^@M-^\There was a$
+monsieur, a London theatrical manager, and a madame who was his wife.$
+There was another monsieur, an American writer, and an English monsieur$
+who was in the employment as secretary to a madame who lives at Cap$
+Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, that is the name. She is a widow, _h√©las_! but immensely rich!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy put the card into his pocket. He had said nothing to the girl$
+about Madame Serpilot since they had left London, and for the first time$
+he had some misgivings as to her safety. Yet in truth that sixth sense$
+of his, which had hitherto worked so to his advantage, offered him no$
+warning that the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys happiness was threatened. He was sure that$
+whatever danger the situation held was danger to him personally. He had$
+not seen the English monsieur who was secretary to Madame Serpilot, but$
+then his back had been toward the far end of the room from whence the$
+man came and he had presented no other view than the back of his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a message from Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am going to get to$
+the bottom of this story if I stay in Monte Carlo for the rest of my$
+life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw Mary back to her hotel, went to his room and changed, and just as$
+the Casino was disgorging its tired clients, he walked through the$
+palm-shaded avenue that led to the main road and began his tramp to Cap$
+Martin. To discover a house in this area by daylight, with the aid of a$
+plan, might have been a simple matter‚M-^@M-^Tby night it presented almost$
+insuperable difficulties.$
+$
+Cap Martin is a promontory of hill and pine and wild flower. Its roads$
+run at the will of its wealthy residents, and there are lanes and paths$
+and broad roads which are not really broad roads at all, but the private$
+entrances to the wonderful villas in which the district abounds, and the$
+grey light was in the eastern sky when Timothy finally located the Villa$
+Condamine.$
+$
+It stood on the edge of the sea, surrounded on the land side by a high$
+wall, though if its owner sought seclusion the woods which surrounded$
+the villa were sufficient.$
+$
+Timothy worked round a little bay until he commanded a view of the place$
+from the sea. A zig-zag path led down from the house to the seashore,$
+terminating in a little concrete quay. Presently he heard the sound of$
+footsteps and a Monogasque workman, in blue overalls, came slouching$
+along the shore path, pipe in mouth.$
+$
+He bade the young man a cheery good morning and stopped, in the friendly$
+way of the Monogasques, to talk. He was a gardener on his way to the$
+villa. He could be on his way to nowhere else, for the rough path on$
+which Timothy stood led straight to a door in the high wall. It was a$
+good job, but he wished he lived nearer. But then, none of madame‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+servants slept in the house, and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! _voil√†!_ It is the Moor!‚M-^@M-^] and he pointed out to sea.$
+$
+A tiny steam yacht was coming slowly to land‚M-^@M-^TTimothy had seen its$
+lights for an hour‚M-^@M-^Tand was steaming now to its anchorage, leaving the$
+line of its wake on the smooth surface of the water.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Moor!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quickly, and then carelessly, ‚M-^@M-^\Has any Moor a$
+villa here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is a great Moor who sometimes$
+comes here from Morocco. A long journey, monsieur. It is five days‚M-^@M-^Y$
+voyage from the Moorish coast‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does he come to the Villa Condamine?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\He is a friend of the madame, and twice has he$
+been there in three months.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was a little splash of water under the bow of the yacht, when the$
+anchor was dropped, and presently a boat drew away and in the stern$
+sheets was a figure muffled in a white jellab.$
+$
+Timothy looked after the retreating figure of the gardener, who was$
+leisurely pursuing his way, and, turning, followed him. It was unlikely$
+that the mysterious madame would allow a humble workman to have the key$
+of the garden gate, yet to his surprise this was the case. The man$
+opened the gate and waited, looking round as if he expected somebody.$
+Timothy guessed that there were two or more workmen and that this$
+particular man had the key and admitted the lot. In this surmise he$
+proved to be right. Presently yet another blue-bloused gardener$
+appeared, and the two stood together waiting for a third. He made no$
+appearance, and the two men passed through the door and pulled it close$
+behind them.$
+$
+Timothy quickened his pace. As he had thought, the door was left ajar$
+for the third man. He pushed it open gently, but saw nothing but the end$
+of a twisting path, which disappeared between high hedges of lilac.$
+$
+If ever there was a time to take a chance it was now; and he was through$
+the gate, gingerly treading the path, before he realised what he had$
+done. He heard voices and moved with caution. Then, after about five$
+minutes, he heard the garden gate behind him bang. The third workman had$
+arrived and the exit was closed. He made his way through the pines which$
+served to screen the house from observation. There was nobody in sight,$
+and the voices had died away. He could walk more boldly now and came at$
+last to the edge of the wood in full view of the villa. Between him and$
+the house was about fifty yards of clear space. He took a chance and$
+crossed it, his objective being a ground-floor window which was open.$
+$
+The entrance was not so easily effected as he had expected. The sill of$
+the window was just above the level of his head, and offered no grip to$
+his hands. He made a tour of reconnaissance, but failed to find any$
+other entrance. Behind the sill, he thought, must be a window frame, and$
+stepping back two paces he made a leap and gripped the frame. Quickly he$
+pulled himself up and dropped into the room.$
+$
+He was conscious of a sweet, fragrant perfume the moment his head became$
+level with the window, and now he saw the explanation. The bare floor$
+was covered three inches thick with rose petals. Evidently the owner$
+made her own perfumery, and this hobby explained the open window. There$
+was no furniture in the room, which was apparently given up to the$
+purpose of drying the petals. The door was unfastened, and he passed$
+into a stone corridor. The structure of the house puzzled him. He did$
+not expect to find himself in the basement; then he remembered that the$
+villa was built on sloping ground, and that the main entrance must be on$
+a higher floor.$
+$
+A flight of stone steps led to the upper level, and he went up$
+cautiously, a step at a time, and found his exit barred by a door which$
+was fastened on the other side with padlock and staple. It was a$
+primitive method of locking up a cellar, and Timothy, remembering that$
+he had passed a recess filled with garden tools, went back to find the$
+means to remove this obstruction. A long chisel prised the staples from$
+the door with ridiculous ease.$
+$
+He heard voices speaking in low, guarded tones and moved along the$
+carpeted hall on tiptoe. He listened at the door of the room from which$
+the voices proceeded, and was in two minds as to what his next step$
+should be. The door was one of two let in the same wall. He stopped and$
+brought his ear to the keyhole of the second and there was no sound.$
+Turning the handle, he looked in.$
+$
+As he expected, it was separated from the other room by a pair of$
+folding doors which were closed. The voices were more distinct but still$
+indistinguishable. He was now in a small drawing-room, well but not$
+luxuriously furnished. Tall French windows led to a loggia, and, what$
+was more important, on either side of these hung long velvet curtains,$
+which might serve, in case of necessity, as a place of concealment.$
+$
+He heard the door of the next room open, and the voices proceeded along$
+the passage. Then the handle of his own door turned. He had just time to$
+slip behind the curtains before somebody entered. It was a woman, and at$
+the sound of her voice he nearly jumped. She was speaking to somebody in$
+the passage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He has gone to his room,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Have your breakfast. He will want$
+you to go into Monte Carlo this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\By daylight?‚M-^@M-^] said the person to whom she spoke, and again Timothy$
+recognised the voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He would not know you with those spectacles. Besides, you had a$
+moustache when you saw him before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man in the passage mumbled something, and Timothy heard the door of$
+the room close. There was a desk, he had noticed, against the blank wall$
+of the room, and it was to this she made her way. He heard the$
+scratching of her pen on paper, then he walked from his place of$
+concealment. Her back was to him and she did not hear him until his$
+shadow fell across the table. Then, with a little cry, she leapt up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good morning, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XXI$
+$
+$
+SADIE MAXELL was as white as the paper on which she had been writing.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you get in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy did not answer. He stepped round so that he was between the$
+woman and the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where is Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to know of him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lower your voice, if you please,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What is$
+Cartwright to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She licked her dry lips before she spoke. Then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I married Cartwright or Benson in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tyears ago,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+Timothy took a step back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You married Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said incredulously. ‚M-^@M-^\That explains why you$
+came away?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was looking at him steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it wanted any explanation‚M-^@M-^Tyes,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to$
+do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going after the man you have upstairs, the fake Moor, who came into$
+this house half an hour ago, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to hand him to justice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before he knew what had happened, she gripped him by his coat with both$
+hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are not going to do anything of the kind, Mr. ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said between her teeth, and her voice trembled with$
+passion. ‚M-^@M-^\I hated him once, but that was before I knew him. I would$
+sooner see you dead as the other man died than that you should bring him$
+more trouble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let me go,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, trying to press loose her hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll leave this house and forget that you were ever here. Oh, you$
+fool, you fool!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had wrenched himself clear of her and flung her backward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have a few words to say to your friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I think you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better stay here whilst I‚M-^@M-^Ym saying them. I hate having family quarrels$
+in public, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had not heard the door open behind him and it was the ‚M-^@M-^\swish‚M-^@M-^] of the$
+loaded cane which warned him. It did not strike him fair on the head, as$
+was intended, but caught him a glancing blow and he fell on his knees,$
+turning his face to his attacker. He knew it was Brown even before the$
+blow fell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I settle him?‚M-^@M-^] said a voice as the stick went up again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no!‚M-^@M-^] cried the woman, ‚M-^@M-^\for God‚M-^@M-^Ys sake, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was at that moment that Timothy low-tackled his assailant. Brown$
+tried to strike, but he was too late and went crashing to the floor, his$
+head against the wall. He made one effort to rise, and then with a groan$
+collapsed.$
+$
+Timothy rose, shaking himself and rubbing his bruised shoulder. Without$
+a word, and with only a look at the woman, he made for the door and$
+banged it in her face. His head was swimming as he made his way up the$
+stairs, swaying at every step. From the broad landing at the top led$
+three doors, only one of which was closed. He turned the handle and went$
+in.$
+$
+A man was standing by the window, which overlooked the calm expanse of$
+ocean, glittering in the light of the rising sun. From shoulder to heel$
+he was clad in a long white mantle and a dark blue turban encircled his$
+head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\you and I will settle accounts.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man had not moved at the sound of the voice, but when Timothy had$
+finished he turned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My God!‚M-^@M-^] cried Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\TIMOTHY,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary, ‚M-^@M-^\I was just thinking about that beautiful house$
+you took me to see at Cap Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Were you, dear?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy without any show of interest.$
+$
+They were on the cross-Channel boat and Boulogne was astern.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you know, I had a feeling that you had taken$
+me there to show me to somebody, some friend of yours perhaps. All the$
+time I was walking about the garden I had a sense of being watched. It$
+is not an uncomfortable sensation, but just that overlooked feeling one$
+has sometimes. I love Monte Carlo. Do you think we shall go back there$
+after‚M-^@M-^Tafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is likely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl rose and went forward along the deck to get a view of a passing$
+destroyer. Timothy took a letter from his pocket and read it for about$
+the twentieth time. It was undated and began:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MY DEAR ANDERSON,‚M-^@M-^TI cannot tell you how grateful I am to you$
+    for your kindness and for the big, generous sympathy you have$
+    shown me. Especially am I glad that you brought Mary so that I$
+    could see her again, for I just hungered for a sight of the$
+    child. Won‚M-^@M-^Yt you please forgive Sadie? She acted without my$
+    knowledge but in my interests, as she thought, in trying to keep$
+    you away from Monte Carlo after she had planned to bring the$
+    girl so that I could see her.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I killed Cartwright, but I shot him in self-defence. His$
+    body lies at the bottom of a disused well in the garden of my$
+    house. It is perfectly true that I had been associated in$
+    business with him and that I was in his Moorish syndicate and$
+    heavily involved. I was so very deeply involved at one time, and$
+    so near to ruin that, deceived by some statement which had been$
+    made to Sadie‚M-^@M-^Ys fortune, I made her acquaintance and married$
+    her. During the past year I have never ceased to thank God that$
+    I did so, for she had been the most loyal companion and friend$
+    that a man could desire.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\It was I who fired the shot through my own window. I$
+    contemplated flight from Cartwright, and was manufacturing$
+    evidence against him in advance‚M-^@M-^TGod forgive me. Sadie guessed,$
+    and when she watched me drawing from the well the bag containing$
+    proof that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys charge was not wholly false, she knew$
+    the end was near.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I am perfectly happy, and spend most of my time developing my$
+    property in Morocco, under the protection of El Mograb, an old$
+    Moorish friend of mine, and the supreme protection of the$
+    Sultan, who, as the Pretender, received considerable help from$
+    me. I am six months of the year with Sadie, for Sadie either$
+    lives on the Riviera or at Cadiz and is easily reachable in my$
+    hired yacht.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I think it best for all concerned, and especially for our dear$
+    Mary, that I remain as dead. Some day the whole story may be$
+    told, but no useful purpose would be served by publishing it$
+    to-day. The card with the message was intended for her, but I am$
+    glad that it fell into your hands. As you guessed, it was I who$
+    flung Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys money into your room‚M-^@M-^TI dared not post it to her$
+    for fear I was betrayed by my writing, and I knew that you were$
+    safe. God bless you both and bring you happiness and prosperity,$
+    to which I hope this property of mine will one day contribute.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy folded the letter and was putting it in his pocket, then changed$
+his mind and took it out. He read it again, then tore it into pieces and$
+flung it over the side of the ship.$
+$
+Then he too went forward to the wife he had married in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tmuch$
+against the wishes of a scandalised Mrs. Renfrew‚M-^@M-^Twho nevertheless$
+termed it ‚M-^@M-^\a pretty romance‚M-^@M-^] in the article she wrote for the _Bath$
+County Herald_.$

+$
+$
+    A Wonder for$
+    Wise Men$
+    By$
+    Wallace B. Nichols$
+$
+    THOUGH an historical romance, this book is much more than$
+    that, for its theme touches present-day ideas in a remarkable$
+    manner, especially as concerns the hideous uselessness of war.$
+    It is set in the reign of Henry VII and deals with the aftermath$
+    of the Wars of the Roses. The principal character becomes one of$
+    the King‚M-^@M-^Ys most trusted instruments in the founding of modern$
+    England, and the story marches to an emotional and uplifting$
+    close. This is an historical novel where the characters are not$
+    puppets of impossible romance, but living human beings as real$
+    as the people about us every day.$

+$
+    SECRET MARKET$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This is a first novel by one of our younger poets, and it is a$
+    novel which equally plainly shows him to be an artist. The plot$
+    is cleverly developed, and the story ends at once dramatically$
+    and artistically.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The Glasgow Herald._$
+$
+    BRITTLE GLORY$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Wallace B. Nichols deserves congratulation. He has demonstrated$
+    a capacity for expression, in terms of strength, beauty and$
+    sincerity, through two mediums. It is an uncommon book with an$
+    outstanding quality: it never ceases to be readable.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The$
+    Observer._$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Nichols has all the gifts of a great novelist: an unerring sense$

+    Mr. Fortune$
+    Explains$
+    By$
+    H. C. Bailey$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MR. FORTUNE‚M-^@M-^] has long since established himself as one of the$
+    brightest stars in the galaxy of modern crime detectives. He$
+    works on the friendliest terms with Scotland Yard, but his$
+    methods‚M-^@M-^Tand incidentally his manners‚M-^@M-^Tare peculiarly his own.$
+    Here we have a series of the most widely divergent mysteries$
+    successively solved by a bland, imperturbable middle-aged$
+    gentleman whose sole concern in life appears to be that he shall$
+    not miss his lunch or any other comfort that is due to him. No$
+    one who has read other ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Fortune‚M-^@M-^] volumes will on any account$
+    miss this, while those who have yet to make the dear man‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+    acquaintance are to be envied for the joy that awaits them.$

+              Mr. Fortune Speaking   My Lady of Orange, etc.$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   Mr. H. C. Bailey is not only a master in the realm of historic$
+    romance, but in that of the mystery story as well: in fact, he is$
+    easily one of the best and most logical of all the many writers of$
+    the detective story to-day.$

+    The Subway$
+    Mystery$
+    By$
+    Ben Bolt$
+$
+    ONE would think it impossible for anybody to walk down into$
+    the crowded new Piccadilly Circus Tube Station and there be$
+    swiftly murdered without immediate discovery of the assassin.$
+    But from the slenderest of clues the whole failure of a great$
+    vengeance is discovered, and Mr. Ben Bolt has provided in his$
+    new story a series of situations and adventures that would keep$
+    the sleepiest reader agog for the end.$

+$
+    ADMIRERS of ‚M-^@M-^\Wee Macgreegor‚M-^@M-^] and kindred works will be$
+    interested to see what the talented author makes of a more$
+    ambitious theme. Subtle characterization is here combined with$
+    the thrills of an Armada treasure hunt, complicated by the$
+    misunderstandings and perplexities of three widely divergent$
+    love affairs. The scenes are laid partly in Spain, partly in the$
+    Western Isles, and what with bloodstained daggers, mysterious$
+    scraps of parchment, buried caskets, plotting priests,$
+    mysterious garden-haunting strangers, and speedy motor-boats,$
+    the reader is kept constantly guessing.$

+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of$

+computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It$
+exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations$

+goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will$

+Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure$
+and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future$
+generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see$

+Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg$
+Literary Archive Foundation$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide$
+spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of$
+increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be$
+freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest$
+array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations$
+($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt$
+status with the IRS.$
+$
+The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating$
+charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United$
+States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a$
+considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up$
+with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations$
+where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND$
+DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular$
+state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we$
+have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition$
+against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who$
+approach us with offers to donate.$
+$
+International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make$
+any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from$
+outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.$
+$
+Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation$
+methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other$
+ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To$
+donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.$
+$
+Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project$
+Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be$
+freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and$
+distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of$
+volunteer support.$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed$
+editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in$
+the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not$
+necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper$
+edition.$
+$
+Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search$
+facility: www.gutenberg.org$
+$
+This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,$
+including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to$
+subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.$

+                               CHAPTER I$
+$
+$
+IT was two hours after the muezzin had called to evening prayer, and$
+night had canopied Tangier with a million stars. In the little Sok, the$
+bread-sellers sat cross-legged behind their wares, their candles burning$
+steadily, for there was not so much as the whisper of a wind blowing.$
+The monotonous strumming of a guitar from a Moorish caf√©, the agonised$
+_barlak!_ of a belated donkey-driver bringing his charge down the steep$
+streets which lead to the big bazaar, the shuffle of bare feet on$
+Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys cobbles, and the distant hush-hush of the rollers breaking$
+upon the amber shore‚M-^@M-^Tthese were the only sounds which the night held.$
+$
+John Maxell sat outside the Continental Caf√©, in the condition of bodily$
+content which a good dinner induces. Mental content should have$
+accompanied such a condition, but even the memory of a perfect dinner$
+could not wholly obliterate a certain uneasiness of mind. He had been$
+uneasy when he came to Tangier, and his journey through France and Spain$
+had been accompanied by certain apprehensions and doubts which$
+Cartwright had by no means dispelled.$
+$
+Rather, by his jovial evasions, his cheery optimism, and at times his$
+little irritable outbreaks of temper, he had given the eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Counsel further cause for disquiet.$
+$
+Cartwright sat at the other side of the table, and was unusually quiet.$
+This was a circumstance which was by no means displeasing to Maxell, for$
+the night was not conducive to talk. There are in Northern Africa many$
+nights like this, when one wishes to sit in dead silence and let thought$
+take its own course, unchecked and untrammelled. In Morocco such nights$
+are common and, anyway, Maxell had always found it difficult to discuss$
+business matters after dinner.$
+$
+Cartwright had no temperament and his quiet was due to other causes. It$
+was he who broke the silence, knocking out his pipe on the iron-topped$
+table with a clang which jarred his more sensitive companion to the very$
+spine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd stake my life and my soul on there being a reef,‚M-^@M-^] he said with a$
+suddenness which was almost as jarring. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, you‚M-^@M-^Yve seen the outcrop$
+for yourself, and isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it exactly the same formation as you see on the$
+Rand?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell nodded.$
+$
+Though a common-law man, he had been associated in mining cases and had$
+made a very careful study of the whole problem of gold extraction.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It looks right enough to me,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but as against that we have the$
+fact that some clever engineers have spent a great deal of time and$
+money trying to locate the reef. That there is gold in Morocco everybody$
+knows, and I should say, Cartwright, that you are right. But where is$
+the reef? It would cost a fortune to bore, even though we had the other$
+borings to guide us.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other made an impatient noise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if the reef were all mapped out it would be a simple matter,$
+but then we shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt get on to it, as we are to-day, at the cost of a$
+few thousands. Hang it all, Maxell, we‚M-^@M-^Yve got to take a certain amount$
+of risk! I know it‚M-^@M-^Ys a gamble quite as well as you. There‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+arguing that point with me. But other things are gambles too. Law was a$
+gamble to you for many years, and a bigger gamble after you took silk.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was a sore point with Maxell, as the other knew. A prosperous$
+junior, he had been called within the Bar, and taken upon himself the$
+function and style of King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsellor in the hope that his prosperity$
+would still further be expanded. And, like so many other men, he had$
+discovered that the successful junior is not necessarily the successful$
+K.C.$
+$
+Fortunately for him, he had long before contested and won a seat in$
+Parliament, and his service to the Government of the day had to some$
+extent ensured his future. But, financially, he had suffered$
+considerably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\silk isn‚M-^@M-^Yt any great catch to a man, I agree; and it was$
+certainly a gamble, and a losing gamble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Which reminds me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there was a talk, before I left$
+London, that you would be given Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is extremely unlikely,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Anyway, if they make me$
+Solicitor-General, that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt carry Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It carries a lot of money,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright after a pause for a moment,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and it‚M-^@M-^Ys money that counts just now, Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the lawyer nodded.$
+$
+He might have added that, but for the need for money, he would long$
+since have dropped his association with Alfred Cartwright, though$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood very high in certain circles of the City of$
+London. They had been at school together, though in that period there$
+had been no very great friendship between them. And Cartwright was$
+marked out for success from the beginning. He inherited a considerable$
+business when his father died, and he enlarged and improved upon it. He$
+had taken up a hundred and one outside interests, and had made most of$
+them pay. A few of them did not pay, and it was whispered that the$
+losses upon his failures took a considerable slice of the balance that$
+accrued from his successes.$
+$
+They had met again when Maxell was a junior and Cartwright the defendant$
+in a case which, had he lost, would have made him some thirty thousand$
+pounds the poorer. When Maxell thought back upon that event, he had to$
+confess that it was not a pleasant case, being one in which Cartwright$
+had been charged with something which was tantamount to$
+misrepresentation; and, although he had won, and won brilliantly, he had$
+never felt any great pride in his achievement.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said (the pauses were frequent and long), ‚M-^@M-^\I should hardly$
+imagine that the Prime Minister loves me to that extent. In Parliament$
+you have to be an uncomfortable quantity to be really successful. You$
+must be strong enough to have a national following, and sufficiently$
+independent to keep the Whips guessing. I am known as a safe man, and I$
+hold a safe seat, which I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose if I tried. That doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt make$
+for promotion. Of course, I could have had an Under-Secretaryship for$
+the asking, and that means a couple of thousand a year, but it also$
+means that you last out the life of the administration in a subordinate$
+capacity, and that, by the time you have made good, your party is in the$
+cold shade of opposition, and there are no jobs going.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head, and returned immediately to the question of the$
+missing reef, as though he wished to take the subject from his own$
+personal affairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You say that it would cost us a lot of money if the reef was proved,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it costing us a lot now?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is. As a matter of fact,‚M-^@M-^] he confessed, ‚M-^@M-^\the actual reef is$
+costing nothing, or next to nothing, because El Mograb is helping me. In$
+our own business‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, in the Syndicate‚M-^@M-^Tour expenses are$
+more or less small; but I am doing a little independent buying, and that$
+has meant the spending of money. I am taking up all the ground to the$
+south of the Angera‚M-^@M-^Ta pretty expensive business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is rather worrying me, you know, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\your$
+scheme is ever so much too ambitious. I was figuring it out this$
+afternoon as I was sitting in my room, and I came to the conclusion$
+that, if the scheme as you outlined it to me yesterday went through, it$
+would mean your finding two millions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Three,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the other cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\but think what it means,$
+Maxell! Supposing it went through. Supposing we struck a reef, and the$
+reef continued, as I believe it will, through the country I am taking$
+up! Why, it may mean a hundred millions to me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other sighed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have reached the point where I think a hundred thousand is an$
+enormous sum,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\However, you know your own business best,$
+Cartwright. But I want to be satisfied in the matter in which we are$
+associated together, that my liability does not exceed my power to pay.$
+And there is another matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright guessed the ‚M-^@M-^\other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was looking over your titles this afternoon,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\and I see$
+no reference to the old Spanish working. I remember that you told me a$
+Spaniard had taken up a considerable stretch of country and had$
+exhausted his capital trying to prove the reef‚M-^@M-^TSe√±or Brigot, wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+that his name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded curtly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A drunkard‚M-^@M-^Tand a bad lot,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\His moral character doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt count so far as the details go; what does$
+matter is that if your theory is correct, the reef must run through his$
+property. What are you going to do about that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Buy him out,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+He rose abruptly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym walking up to the Sok,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Come along?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They tramped up the long, steep hill-street together, and they did not$
+speak till they had passed through the ancient gate into the unrelieved$
+gloom which lies outside the city.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand you, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tyou take an old man‚M-^@M-^Ys view of things,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said Cartwright irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre comparatively young, you‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+good-looker. Why the devil don‚M-^@M-^Yt you marry, and marry money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you ever tried to marry money?‚M-^@M-^] he asked dryly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said the other after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\but I should think it is pretty$
+simple.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try it,‚M-^@M-^] said the laconic Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\It is simple in books, but in real$
+life it is next to impossible. I go about a great deal in society of all$
+kinds, and I can tell you that I have never yet met an eligible spinster$
+with money‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, large money. I agree with you,‚M-^@M-^] he went on$
+after a while, ‚M-^@M-^\a man like myself should marry. And he should marry$
+well. I could give a woman a good position, but she‚M-^@M-^Ys got to be the$
+right kind of woman. There are some times when I‚M-^@M-^Ym just frantic about my$
+position. I am getting older‚M-^@M-^TI am forty-seven next birthday‚M-^@M-^Tand every$
+day that slips past is a day lost. I ought to be married, but I can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+afford a wife. It is a blackguardly thing to talk about money in$
+connection with marriage and yet somehow I can think of nothing$
+else‚M-^@M-^Twhenever the thought arises in my mind I see an imaginary beauty$
+sitting on a big bag of gold!‚M-^@M-^] He chuckled to himself. ‚M-^@M-^\Let‚M-^@M-^Ys go back,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the big Sok always gives me the creeps.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Something lumbered past him in the darkness, some big, overpowering$
+beast with an unpleasant smell, and a guttural voice cried in Arabic:$
+‚M-^@M-^\Beware!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Camels!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright briefly. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre bringing in the stuff for$
+the morning market. The night‚M-^@M-^Ys young yet, Maxell. Let us go up to the$
+theatre.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt even know the theatre was open.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is called theatre by courtesy,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\the$
+inhabitants refer to it as the circus. It‚M-^@M-^Ys a big wooden place on the$
+sea edge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know it, I know it,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\What is being played? The only$
+people I have ever seen there have been Spanish artistes‚M-^@M-^Tand pretty bad$
+artistes, too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, there‚M-^@M-^Ys a treat for you. It is an English company, or rather, a$
+variety company with a number of English turns,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\We$
+might do worse‚M-^@M-^Tat least, I might,‚M-^@M-^] he added ominously.$
+$
+When they reached the theatre they found it sparsely filled. Cartwright$
+took one of the open boxes, and his companion settled himself into a$
+corner to smoke. The turns were of the kind which are usually to be met$
+with on the Levant; a tawdrily attired lady sang a humorous song in$
+Spanish, the humour being frankly indecent. There were a juggler and a$
+man with performing dogs, and then ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^] was announced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, turning to the programme.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may even be Irish,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell dryly.$
+$
+The wheezy little orchestra played a few bars and the girl came on. She$
+was pretty‚M-^@M-^Tthere was no doubt about that‚M-^@M-^Tand of a prettiness which$
+satisfied both men. She was also British or American, for the song she$
+sang was in a French with which both men were familiar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is horrible to see an English girl in a place like this and in such$
+company,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder where she‚M-^@M-^Ys staying,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, half to himself, and a$
+contemptuous little smile curled Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going to rescue her from her infamous surroundings?‚M-^@M-^] he asked,$
+and Cartwright snapped round on him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wish to heaven you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic, Maxell. That‚M-^@M-^Ys twice this$
+evening‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, snicking off the ash of his cigar. ‚M-^@M-^\I am in a$
+cynical mood to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He raised his hands to applaud the girl as she bowed herself from the$
+stage, and glanced round the house. Three boxes away was a small party$
+of men, whom he judged were the sons of prosperous members of the$
+Spanish colony. Their fingers flashed with diamonds, their cigarettes$
+burnt from jewelled holders. Cartwright followed the direction of the$
+other‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys made a hit, that Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\These fellows will be$
+tumbling over one another to present her with verbal bouquets. I wonder$
+where she lives!‚M-^@M-^] he said again.$
+$
+Presently the young men rose in a body and left the box, and Cartwright$
+grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you mind hanging on here whilst I go outside?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a bit,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\Where are you off to? To find out where$
+she lives?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you go again,‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I think Tangier makes you$
+liverish.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When he had got to the promenade, the men had disappeared, but a$
+question directed to the head attendant revealed, as he had expected,$
+the objective of the little party at the stage door.$
+$
+The stage door was reached from the outside of the theatre and involved$
+a journey over rubble and brick heaps. Presently he came to an open$
+doorway, where sat a solitary half-caste smoking a pipe and reading an$
+old _Heraldo_.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, _hombre_,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in Spanish, ‚M-^@M-^\have you seen my three$
+friends come in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] nodded the man; ‚M-^@M-^\they have just entered.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He indicated the direction, which lay through a dark and smelly passage.$
+$
+Cartwright walked along this stuffy hallway, and, turning the corner,$
+came upon an interesting group gathered about a closed door, against$
+which one, and the least sober, of the party was hammering. Near by$
+stood a small, stout man in soiled evening dress, grinning his approval,$
+and it was clear that the visitors were at once known and welcome.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open the door, my dream of joy,‚M-^@M-^] hiccupped the young man, hammering at$
+the panel. ‚M-^@M-^\We have come to bring you homage and adoration‚M-^@M-^Ttell her to$
+open the door, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he addressed the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, and$
+the small man minced forward and spoke in English.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is all right, my dear. Some friends of mine wish to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A voice inside, which Cartwright recognised, answered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not see them. Tell them to go away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You hear?‚M-^@M-^] said the manager, shrugging his shoulders. ‚M-^@M-^\She will not see$
+you. Now go back to your seats and let me persuade her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or!‚M-^@M-^] He raised his eyebrows to the unexpected apparition of$
+Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you doing here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is forbidden to enter the theatre through the saloon of artistes,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the small man pompously. ‚M-^@M-^\If Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your friend, you must$
+wait for her until the performance is over.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright took no notice. He was a tall man of athletic build and$
+shouldering his way past the others with no difficulty, he tapped on the$
+panel.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\here is an English visitor wants to see you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English?‚M-^@M-^] said the voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Come in for the love of Mike!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The door was opened, and a girl with a silk kimono pulled over her stage$
+dress, offered him a smiling welcome. The young Spaniard who had been$
+hammering on the panel of the door would have followed, but Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+arm barred him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want this fellow?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do I want him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady bitterly, ‚M-^@M-^\do I want the scarlet$
+fever or measles? You bet I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want him. He‚M-^@M-^Ys been pestering me ever$
+since I‚M-^@M-^Yve been here.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you hear what the lady says?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, speaking in Spanish.$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does not desire your acquaintance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My father owns this theatre,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man loudly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then he‚M-^@M-^Ys got a rotten property,‚M-^@M-^] replied the calm Cartwright.$
+$
+The Spaniard turned in a rage to his soiled satellite.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You will put this man out at once, Jose, or there will be trouble for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little man shrugged his helplessness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said in English, ‚M-^@M-^\you see my unhappy position. The se√±or is$
+the son of my proprietor and it will be bad for me if you stay. I ask$
+you as a friend and caballero to go at once and spare me misfortune.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright looked at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Must you go on again in this infernal place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, laughter and admiration in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens if you chuck this infernal job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym fired,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve a ten weeks‚M-^@M-^Y contract with these$
+people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you get?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two hundred and fifty pesetas a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+wonderful salary, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How many more weeks have you to go before your contract is finished?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another four,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\we‚M-^@M-^Yre playing in Cadiz next week, in Seville$
+the week after, then Malaga, then Granada.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you like it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like it!‚M-^@M-^] the scorn in her voice was her answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The dresses belong to the troupe, I guess,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Get into your$
+street clothes and I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, eyeing him narrowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good your lost contract,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an English girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Irish,‚M-^@M-^] she corrected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean Irish,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an Irish girl doing$
+this kind of thing with a lot of horrible half-breeds. You‚M-^@M-^Yve talent$
+enough for London or Paris. What about Paris? I know any number of$
+people there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Could you get me a good engagement?‚M-^@M-^] she asked eagerly.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys your name, anyway?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never mind about my name. Smith, Brown, Jones, Robinson‚M-^@M-^Tanything you$
+like.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was the agitated little manager who interfered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you must not persuade this lady to leave the theatre. I$
+have her under heavy penalties. I can bring her before the judge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now just forget that!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there is no judge in Tangier.$
+She is a British subject, and the most you can do is to take her before$
+the British Consul.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When she returns to Spain‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said the little man growing apoplectic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She will not return to Spain. She will go to Gibraltar if she goes$
+anywhere,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and from Gibraltar she will be on the sea$
+until she reaches a British port.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will go to the Spanish Consul,‚M-^@M-^] screamed the little manager, clawing$
+the air. ‚M-^@M-^\I will not be robbed. You shall not interfere with my$
+business, you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Much of this, thought Cartwright, was intended for the glowering young$
+Spaniard who stood in the background. He went outside, closed the door$
+and stood with his back toward it. On a whispered instruction from his$
+employer‚M-^@M-^Ys son, whose hands were now flickering fire as he gesticulated$
+in his excitement, Jose the manager disappeared, and returned a few$
+minutes later with two stalwart stage hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Will you leave this theatre at once and quietly?‚M-^@M-^] demanded the foaming$
+manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not leave the theatre until I am ready,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+if I leave otherwise, I shall certainly not leave quietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The manager stood back with a melodramatic gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eject the caballero,‚M-^@M-^] he said finely.$
+$
+The two men hesitated. Then one came forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The se√±or must leave,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In good time, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+A hand gripped his arm, but instantly he had shaken free, and had driven$
+with all his strength at the man‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw. The stage hand dropped like a$
+log. He pushed at the door behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put your kimono over your things,‚M-^@M-^] he said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\You can send the$
+stage kit back to-morrow. There is going to be a rough house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All right,‚M-^@M-^] said a voice behind him, and the girl slipped out, still in$
+her kimono and carrying a bundle of clothes under her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know the way out? I‚M-^@M-^Yll follow you. Now, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he said flippantly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going‚M-^@M-^Tquietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER II$
+$
+$
+HE left behind him a pandemonium of sound and a scintillation of$
+flickering diamonds. He found the girl waiting for him in the darkness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Br-r-r! It‚M-^@M-^Ys cold!‚M-^@M-^] she shivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you staying?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the little hotel opposite the British Consulate,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt much of a place, but it was the only room I could get‚M-^@M-^Tat the$
+price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better not go there,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll send for your boxes in the$
+morning. Give me those clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took them from her and put them under his arm, and she fell in by his$
+side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad to be out of it,‚M-^@M-^] she said breathlessly, taking his arm;$
+‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a dog‚M-^@M-^Ys life. I was going to quit to-morrow. Those boys have been$
+following me round ever since I came to Tangier. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better go back to my hotel, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a moment; ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+pretty tough crowd, these Spaniards, and though I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand their$
+beastly language, I know just what kind of happy holiday they‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+planning for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were in the town, passing up the street of the mosque, when she$
+asked him:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you taking me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the Continental,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like this?‚M-^@M-^] she said in dismay, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have an office in this street,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\you can go in and dress.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you outside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He showed her into the tiny room which served as the headquarters of the$
+Angera Gold Mining Syndicate, and sat on the irregular stone steps,$
+waiting until she was dressed. Presently she came out, a presentable and$
+an attractive figure.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just thought,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you had better to go the$
+Central‚M-^@M-^TI am staying at the Continental and it wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt look nice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been thinking something of the sort myself,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What about$
+my broken engagement? Were you joking when you said you would pay? I$
+hate talking about money, but I am broke‚M-^@M-^TJose owes me a week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good the money to-morrow,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I can give you a tenner$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the idea?‚M-^@M-^] she asked him again. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve read a lot of books, and$
+I know the knight errant business backwards. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt strike me as$
+being a something-for-nothing man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\It occurred to me when I saw you on the$
+stage, that you might be useful. I want a person in Paris I can$
+trust‚M-^@M-^Tsomebody who could look after my interests.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a business woman,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I hate business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Business is done by men,‚M-^@M-^] said he significantly. ‚M-^@M-^\And there are a few$
+men I want you to keep track of. Do you understand that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see,‚M-^@M-^] she said at last. ‚M-^@M-^\It is better than I thought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He did not trouble to ask her what she had thought, or what she imagined$
+he had planned, but saw her into the hotel, arranged for a room, and$
+walked slowly back to the Continental. He was in the vestibule of that$
+hotel before he remembered that he had left an eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel$
+and Member of Parliament smoking his cigar in a _loge_ of the Tangier$
+circus.$
+$

+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I missed you,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell the next morning. ‚M-^@M-^\When you remembered and$
+came to pick me up, I was on my way back‚M-^@M-^Twe must have passed somewhere$
+in the little Sok. What happened last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing much,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\I went round and saw the girl.$
+She was very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How amusing?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, just amusing.‚M-^@M-^] Vaguely: ‚M-^@M-^\I found her annoyed by the attention which$
+was being paid to her by a veritable Spanish hidalgo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you sailed in and rescued her, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\And what happened$
+to her after she was rescued?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I saw her home to her hotel, and there the matter ended. By the way,$
+she leaves by the _Gibel Musa_ for Gibraltar this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] Maxell looked absently at the letter he had in his hand, folded it$
+and put it away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is the mail in?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright, interested, and Maxell nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve had your daily letter from your kiddie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is not a baby letter, but it is very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How old is she?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She must be nine or ten,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is just coincidence, or whether it is fate,‚M-^@M-^] mused$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is a coincidence?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve got a kid to look after, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym in a sort of way$
+responsible for a bright lad. Mine is less interesting than yours, I$
+think. Anyway, he‚M-^@M-^Ys a boy and a sort of cousin. He has two fool parents$
+who were born to slavery‚M-^@M-^Tthe sort of people who are content to work for$
+somebody all their lives and regard revolt against their condition as an$
+act of impiety. I‚M-^@M-^Yve only seen the kid once, and he struck me as the$
+sort who might break loose from that kind of life and take a chance.$
+Otherwise, I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have interested myself in him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How far does your interest extend?‚M-^@M-^] asked Maxell curiously. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not$
+the sort of person, I should imagine, who would take up the unfortunate$
+poor as a hobby.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a something-for-nothing man, in fact,‚M-^@M-^] laughed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been told that twice in twenty-four hours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who was the other person‚M-^@M-^Tthe actress?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright roared with laughter and slapped the other on the knee.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No, I am not a something-for-nothing$
+person. I‚M-^@M-^Ym one of those optimists who plant fir cones so that I shall$
+have some good firewood for my old age. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what sort of a man$
+Timothy will make, but, as I say, he shapes good, and anyway, you and I$
+are in the same boat.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except this,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\that from what you say, you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+particularly interested in your prot√©g√©, and you don‚M-^@M-^Yt really care$
+whether he shapes good or shapes bad.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys true,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an experiment.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little girl is something more than that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell quietly;$
+‚M-^@M-^\she‚M-^@M-^Ys the only living thing I have any real affection for‚M-^@M-^Tshe is my$
+dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your niece, eh? Well, that gives you an interest which I have not. I$
+never had a niece and I should just hate to be called uncle, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Their conversation was interrupted at this point by the arrival of a$
+small man dressed in his best clothes. On his brow was a frown which was$
+intended to be terrible, but was slightly amusing. Jose Ferreira had$
+dressed and prepared himself for an interview which, as he had described$
+to his friends, could not fail to be at once ‚M-^@M-^\terrifying and vital.‚M-^@M-^]$
+For, as he had said: ‚M-^@M-^\This man has sliced my life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He began his speech to Cartwright as he had rehearsed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Estoy indignado‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T_‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright cut him short with an expression of mock fear.$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Horroroso!_ You are indignant, are you? Well, come, little man, and$
+tell me why you are indignant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] said the man solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\you have put upon me a humiliation and$
+a shame which all my life I shall regret.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The conversation was in Spanish, but Maxell was an excellent Spanish$
+scholar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, before Jose, still labouring under the$
+sense of his wrongs, could get going again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen to him and discover,‚M-^@M-^] mocked Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have taken from his$
+incomparable company its joy and its gem.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In other words, the amiable Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, yes, se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] broke in Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\For me it is ruin! The money I have$
+spent to make my company perfect! It is financed by one who is the$
+greatest man in Tangier and it is his son who tells me that, unless I$
+bring back this lady‚M-^@M-^Tfor me there is the street and the gutter,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+wept.$
+$
+Maxell looked slyly at his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys another chance for you to plant a fir cone,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+you find some use for this gentleman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright was not smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] he said crisply, ‚M-^@M-^\you are, as all Spain knows, a thief$
+and a rogue. If you associate with bigger thieves and bigger scoundrels,$
+that is your business. I can only tell you that you may think yourself$
+lucky I did not bring this case before the Spanish Consul. I assure you,$
+you would never have put your foot in Tangier again after the stories I$
+have heard about you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little Spaniard was open-mouthed and impressed. He was also a little$
+frightened. Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation had been at a venture, but he argued$
+that it was scarcely likely that, in an establishment of the description$
+which Mr. Ferreira controlled, there could have been no incidents which$
+reflected upon the manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything which is said about me is a lie!‚M-^@M-^] said the little man$
+vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I have lived a life of the highest virtue! To-day I$
+complain to the British Consul, and we shall see!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Complain,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This chance I will give you.‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Ferreira wagged a fat, stumpy$
+finger. ‚M-^@M-^\Restore to me Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and the matter shall go no$
+farther.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady has left Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] said the other calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\so it is clear$
+to you that I cannot restore her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She has not left,‚M-^@M-^] vociferated the Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\We had a man to watch the$
+boat leaving for the _Gibel Musa_ and she did not leave the pier.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She left the beach,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright patiently; ‚M-^@M-^\she was rowed out$
+by a boatman from the Cecil. At this moment she is half-way to$
+Gibraltar.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira groaned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is ruin for me,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps for you also,‚M-^@M-^] he added$
+ominously. ‚M-^@M-^\I can do no less than depart for Paris to lay this matter$
+before my excellent patron, Se√±or Don‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright jerked his head to the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Get out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and turned his attention to the newspaper which he$
+had picked up from the table.$
+$
+Maxell waited until the little man had gone, still seething with his$
+‚M-^@M-^\indignado,‚M-^@M-^] then turned to Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is rather a serious matter, Cartwright; what has happened to the$
+girl?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you hear? I have sent her to Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt leave a dog in that company. And from Gibraltar she goes home$
+by the first P. & O.,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you ‚M-^@M-^Xhming‚M-^@M-^Y about?‚M-^@M-^] snarled his companion. ‚M-^@M-^\The girl$
+is gone. I shall not see her again. It was an act of charity. Do you$
+disapprove?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you felt so bad about it. No, I$
+think you‚M-^@M-^Yve done the girl a very good turn. But in these days one$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt expect‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blessed is he that expecteth nothing, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright$
+sententiously, ‚M-^@M-^\for he shall not be disappointed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose that$
+the proprietor, whoever he is, cares a snap of his fingers about the$
+matter‚M-^@M-^Tit is his infernal son who will fire the adorable Jose.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+That afternoon the two men had an interview on the outskirts of the town$
+with a very plainly dressed Moor, who came to them so cautiously that$
+the observers might have been pardoned if they thought he was a$
+criminal. In the eyes of the divine rulers of Morocco he was something$
+more than a criminal, because he was an emissary of El Mograb, the$
+Pretender. There was a price upon the messenger‚M-^@M-^Ys head, and his caution$
+was, therefore, commendable. He brought a letter from El Mograb to$
+Cartwright, and it was a message of cheer.$
+$
+Maxell and his friend had gone out early in the afternoon and had waited$
+two hours under a scorching sun for the courier to arrive. For a man of$
+law, the fact that he was coquetting with the Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy did not$
+distress Maxell, who knew the history of the country too well to worry$
+very much about Sultan or Pretender. The Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys reign, marked with the$
+turbulence of people and the self-indulgence of monarch, was already$
+doomed. His uncle, El Mograb, a born leader of men and captain of seven$
+thousand well-armed soldiers, was but waiting the psychological moment$
+to strike; and Adbul, with his motor-cars and brass bedstead, his$
+geegaws and his frippery, would disappear into the limbo which is$
+especially reserved for extravagant and unstable rulers.$
+$
+The news from El Mograb was good. It reconfirmed the concession which$
+one of his shereefs had made on his behalf, and sent a message in$
+flowery Arabic‚M-^@M-^Ta message of thanks to the man who had supplied him with$
+the very necessary rifles.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That was news to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright as they rode back to the town. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you were gun-running, Maxell, or that you were so solid with$
+El Mograb.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I like El Mograb,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the many Moors who have$
+impressed me. You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that I have been visiting Morocco since$
+I was a boy and most of the chiefs are known to me personally. I knew El$
+Mograb‚M-^@M-^Ys brother, who was killed at Tetuan, and when he was a favourite$
+in court circles he entertained me at Fez.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his word worth?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is worth all the contracts that ever went to Somerset House for$
+stamping,‚M-^@M-^] said the other with emphasis. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you can go ahead with$
+your scheme.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go back to London and raise the money,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We shall want a$
+couple of millions eventually, but half a million will do to go on with.$
+You had better be with me in the big scheme, Maxell. There is nothing to$
+lose for you. You‚M-^@M-^Yll be in on the ground floor. What is the good of your$
+pottering about with your little Company‚M-^@M-^TI mean the Parent Company?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have faith in that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I know just the amount of my$
+indebtedness.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\The big scheme may mean$
+millions to you, and I shall want your help and guidance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell hesitated. The lure was dazzling, the prize was immense. But it$
+meant risks which he was not prepared to take. He knew something of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys financial methods; he had seen them in their working, and$
+had done not a little on one occasion to save Cartwright from the$
+consequences of his own cleverness. Yet, as he argued, Cartwright would$
+have no difficulty in raising the money from the general public, and his$
+presence on the board would certainly be a guarantee against his$
+companion departing from the narrow path.$
+$
+Although it was not generally known that he was associated in any of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises, there had been a whisper of an inquiry in$
+influential quarters, and it had been hinted to him that, on the whole,$
+it would be better if he kept himself aloof from the gentleman who,$
+admirable business man as he was, had a passion for enterprises which$
+occasionally verged upon the illegal. But those influential quarters had$
+not whispered anything in the shape of a definite promise that his$
+welfare was entirely in their keeping and that his future would not be$
+overlooked.$
+$
+He was an ambitious man, but his ambitions ran in realisable directions.$
+The services he had rendered to the Government were such as deserved a$
+recognition, and the only question was what form that recognition would$
+take? His knowledge of languages qualified him for an important$
+appointment under the Foreign Office; but the Foreign Office was a close$
+preserve and difficult to break into. There were too many permanent$
+officials who regarded the service as a family affair, and were jealous$
+of patronage outside their own charmed circle.$
+$
+He went in to lunch that day to find Cartwright reading a telegram which$
+he folded up and put into his pocket upon the other‚M-^@M-^Ys appearance.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little friend has arrived in Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+Maxell looked at him curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens now?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym sending her home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys voice was brisk and he spoke in the manner of a man$
+referring to a topic too unimportant to be discussed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^] pursued Maxell, and the other shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have given her a letter of introduction to a friend of mine,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+carelessly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have one or two theatrical interests in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell said nothing, and could have dismissed the matter as lightly as$
+his companion, for the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys future scarcely interested him.$
+$
+She had been but a figure on the stage; her personality, her very$
+appearance, left no definite impression. But if he was not interested in$
+the girl, he was interested in Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private mind. Here was a man$
+of whom he could not know too much. And somehow he felt that he had$
+hardly cracked the surface of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys character though he had known$
+him for years, and though they were working together to a common end.$
+$
+The way of a man with a maid is wonderful, but it is also instructive to$
+the cold-blooded onlooker, who discovers in that way a kind of creature$
+he has never met before; a new man, so entirely different from the$
+familiar being he had met in club or drawing-room as to be almost$
+unrecognisable. And he wanted to know just this side of Cartwright,$
+because it was the side on which he had scarcely any information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you won‚M-^@M-^Yt see her again?‚M-^@M-^] he said, playing with his knife and$
+looking abstractedly out of the window.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt think so,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, and then, with a sudden$
+irritation: ‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you driving at, Maxell? I may see the$
+girl‚M-^@M-^TI go to music-halls, and it is hardly likely I should miss her.$
+Naturally I am interested in the lady I have rescued from this kind of$
+thing‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The waved his hand vaguely toward Tangier Bay‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and she may be$
+useful. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to say _you‚M-^@M-^Yre_ struck on her?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He tried to carry war into the enemy‚M-^@M-^Ys camp and failed, for Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+blue eyes met his steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know what she looks like,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am not likely to$
+fall in love with a lady who left absolutely no impression upon me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+He left next day on the boat for Cadiz, _en route_ to Paris and London,$
+and he and Cartwright had as a fellow-passenger a shabby little man$
+whose belongings were packed in an American-cloth suit-case inscribed in$
+flourishing capitals, evidently by the owner, ‚M-^@M-^\Jose Ferreira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira spent most of his time on the ship‚M-^@M-^Ys deck, biting his nails$
+and enlarging his grievance against the unconscious Cartwright.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER III$
+$
+$
+MAXELL did not stay many hours in Paris. The Sud Express landed him in$
+the French capital at seven in the morning. He left Paris by the midday$
+train for London. The Long Vacation was drawing to an end, and there$
+were briefs of certain importance requiring examination. There was also$
+a consultation with the Attorney-General on an interpretation of a$
+clause in the new Shipping Act, and he was also due to address his$
+constituents before the reassembling of Parliament.$
+$
+He might ruminate in vain to find one attractive feature of his$
+programme. Parliament wearied him, and the ordinary practices of the law$
+no longer gave him pleasure.$
+$
+There was an interest in the work he was doing for the Government, and$
+if he had the faintest hint of pleasure in his immediate prospects, the$
+cause was to be found in the vexed problems centring about this new, and$
+loosely drawn, shipping law. It was a measure which had been passed in a$
+hurry, and when the acid test of litigation had been applied, some of$
+its weak points had been discovered.$
+$
+The weakest of these points was one affecting the load-line. In an$
+action heard before a High Court Judge, the doubtful clause had been$
+interpreted so as to render the Act a dead letter; and there were$
+particular and especial Governmental reasons why the appeal which the$
+Government had made from the verdict of the lower Court should upset$
+that decision.$
+$
+There is no need to give the particulars of the great dispute, which$
+arose over the three words ‚M-^@M-^\or otherwise loaded,‚M-^@M-^] and it is only$
+necessary to say that, before he had reached London, Mr. Maxell had$
+discovered a way for the Government out of their difficulty.$
+$
+It was this opinion which he delivered to a relieved Attorney-General,$
+and, with the new argument, the Government were able to present so$
+strong a case to the Court of Appeal, that a month after his return the$
+verdict of the lower Court was reversed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney-General, ‚M-^@M-^\the devils can take it to the House$
+of Lords now and still lose‚M-^@M-^Tthanks to your brain wave, Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were smoking in the Crown Room at the Law Courts after the decision$
+had been delivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where have you been for your holiday, by the way?‚M-^@M-^] asked the Attorney$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco?‚M-^@M-^] The Attorney nodded thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you hear anything of$
+friend Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We were staying at the same hotel,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A weird person,‚M-^@M-^] said the thoughtful Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\A very curious$
+man‚M-^@M-^Twhat a Chancellor that fellow would make!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He never struck me that way,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know him well‚M-^@M-^TI mean, are you a particular friend of his?‚M-^@M-^]$
+demanded the Attorney.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\I know him‚M-^@M-^Tso many men in the law$
+know him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not by any chance associating with him in business now, are$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell promptly.$
+$
+It was a lie and he knew it was a lie. It was told deliberately from the$
+desire to stand well in the eyes of his friends. He knew Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reputation well enough, and just how he was regarded by the party whom$
+he had served for three years. Cartwright had been Member for a London$
+borough, but had resigned. ‚M-^@M-^\Pressure of business‚M-^@M-^] was the excuse he$
+gave, but there were people who said that it was owing to the pressure$
+of the Party Whips, who smelt a somewhat unsavoury case coming into$
+Court with Cartwright figuring prominently.$
+$
+There is no way of proving or disproving the statement, because the case$
+in which Cartwright most decidedly was interested was withdrawn from the$
+list at the last moment. The uncharitable say that it cost Cartwright a$
+small fortune to bring about this withdrawal, and certainly one of the$
+ladies interested (she was a small-part actress at the Hippoceus) gave$
+up her stage work and had been living in affluence ever since.$
+Cartwright pooh-poohed the suggestion that the case held anything$
+sensational‚M-^@M-^Tbut he did not enter political life again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with him,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney simply.$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an awfully nice fellow and I suppose he is as straight and as$
+sound as the best man in the City. But he‚M-^@M-^Ys a shifty fellow‚M-^@M-^Tjust a$
+little bit‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\a little wrong. You understand, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tor$
+shall we say slightly shop-soiled?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is certainly a brilliant man,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, not desirous of$
+defending his friend too vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I suppose he is,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\All men like that are$
+brilliant. What a pity his genius does not run in a smooth channel, but$
+must follow the course of a burning cracker, here, there and everywhere,$
+exploding at every turn!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped down from the table, on the edge of which he had been sitting$
+and pulled off his robe.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad to know you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with Cartwright, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said.$
+$
+Maxell did not attempt to probe beneath the surface of his$
+twice-repeated remark.$
+$
+He went back to Cavendish Square to his flat and to a tiny, solemn-eyed$
+little girl who had been brought up from Hindhead that day on her$
+monthly visit to ‚M-^@M-^\Uncle Max.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright had not accompanied his friend to England, and with good$
+reasons. A great deal of his work was carried out in Paris, where he had$
+an important financial backing. He occupied a flat overlooking the$
+imposing, but none too convenient, Avenue of the Grand Army. His home$
+was at the unfashionable end of this interminable thoroughfare, which$
+meant that his rooms were larger and his rent cheaper, and that he was$
+freer from observation than he would have been had he lived according to$
+his means or station in a luxurious flat nearer the Etoil.$
+$
+He had a board meeting to attend, an informal board meeting, it is true,$
+but none the less important.$
+$
+Cartwright was the chairman and managing director of the London and$
+Paris Gold Syndicate, a flourishing concern which held big blocks of$
+shares in various land and gold-mining companies, and controlled three$
+mines of its own on the West Rand. Though a Company drawing a modest$
+revenue from its Johannesburg property, its operations were not confined$
+to gold development pure and simple. It was, in fact, an outside$
+broker‚M-^@M-^Ys on a grand scale. It gambled heavily and gambled wisely. The$
+shareholders seldom received less than a twelve and a half per cent.$
+dividend, and there were years when in addition it paid a bonus equal to$
+its own share capital.$
+$
+It numbered its clients at one hundred and fifty thousand, the majority$
+being small people who preferred speculation to investment‚M-^@M-^Tcountry$
+parsons, doctors and the small gamblers who lived fearfully on the$
+fringe of high finance. The shares were at a premium and Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+interest brought him a considerable sum annually. What probably$
+attracted the little speculator was the knowledge of the Company‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reserve, which stood in the balance-sheet at a respectable figure. It$
+was the question of these reserves that occupied the attention of the$
+four quiet men who met informally in the room of a Paris hotel.$
+$
+There were three to one against Cartwright, because none of his$
+companions could see eye to eye with him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is too dangerous, M. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Gribber, whose nationality$
+was suspect; ‚M-^@M-^\our risks are already high and we cannot afford, in my$
+judgment, to extend them. The money would be subscribed over and over$
+again if you went to the English public.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt we make the profit?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\we could borrow from our$
+reserve.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That we can‚M-^@M-^Yt touch!‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the cautious Gribber, shaking his$
+head violently. ‚M-^@M-^\My faith, no, we cannot touch that! For it is certain$
+that the lean years will come when our clients will require their$
+dividends.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not pursue the subject. There were other ways of$
+financing his Moorish scheme.$
+$
+The Benson Syndicate, for example.$
+$
+He spoke eloquently of this new venture, which was to have its$
+headquarters in Paris, and would be under the eye of his sceptical$
+co-directors. He mentioned names glibly and easily‚M-^@M-^Tnames that carried$
+weight in the financial world. The three men agreed that the Benson$
+Syndicate had the appearance of a safe investment.$
+$

+$
+More important was the business which brought Alfred Cartwright to the$
+St. Lazaire Station to meet a passenger a week later.$
+$
+She sprang from the train and looked round with doubting face, which$
+lighted the moment she saw the saturnine Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My! I am relieved,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I was scared to think you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be$
+here to meet me, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd only got a few pounds left.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You got my wire?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, and she smiled, showing two rows of pearly$
+teeth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym still mystified,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What is it you want me to do in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us eat first and talk afterwards,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You must be hungry.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym starving!‚M-^@M-^] she laughed.$
+$
+He had a car waiting for her, and whisked her off to a little street$
+leading from the Boulevard des Italiens, where one of the best$
+restaurants in Paris is situated. The girl looked about her with an$
+approving air. The gaiety and luxury of the place appealed to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My word!‚M-^@M-^] she said enviously; ‚M-^@M-^\do you come to lunch here every day?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know this place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve seen it,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but a three-franc dinner at Duval‚M-^@M-^Ys has$
+been my limit so far.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She told him how she had come to the Continent as a dancer, and had$
+‚M-^@M-^\starred‚M-^@M-^] in a tiny little cabaret in Montmartre as one of the ‚M-^@M-^\dashing$
+Sisters Jones,‚M-^@M-^] before she had been seen by the impresario who was$
+recruiting material for his tour through the Levant.$
+$
+Cartwright judged her to be nineteen, knew her to be extremely pretty,$
+and guessed that, under certain conditions, she would be presentable$
+even to the best of the circles in which he moved. He wondered, with a$
+grim smile, what Maxell, that austere and fastidious man, would say if$
+he knew that the girl was with him in Paris. Would Maxell accept her? He$
+thought not. Maxell was a thought straitlaced and in some ways was a$
+bore. But Maxell was necessary. He was a brilliant lawyer, and moreover$
+stood well with the Government, and there might come a time when Maxell$
+would be immensely useful. He could well afford to give the lawyer a$
+slice of the pickings he intended making, because Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys wants were$
+few and his ambitions on the modest side.$
+$
+Cartwright thought in millions. Maxell was a five-figure man. If all$
+went well with Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys scheme, undoubtedly he could well afford the$
+five figures.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happened to your friend?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl, as though divining his$
+thoughts: ‚M-^@M-^\The man you told me I was to keep away from. Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+want him to see me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does it really matter?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys in England, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is he?‚M-^@M-^] She was curious.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, a friend of mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And who are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, facing him squarely. ‚M-^@M-^\If I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see$
+anything of you in Paris, that Smith, Brown or Robinson business isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+quite good enough. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me, but I want to know who I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+working for, and what is the kind of work you want me to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright pinched his neck‚M-^@M-^Ta nervous little trick of his when he was$
+thinking.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business interests here,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt want me for an office?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously. ‚M-^@M-^\My education$
+is perfectly rotten.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you for an office,‚M-^@M-^] he replied with a smile. ‚M-^@M-^\And yet$
+in a sense I want you to do office work. I have a little syndicate here,$
+which is known as the Benson Syndicate. Benson is my name‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Or the name you go by,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How sharp you are! Well, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your name, if it$
+comes to that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She made no reply and he went on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want somebody in Paris I can rely upon; somebody who will receive$
+money, transmit it to the Benson Syndicate, and re-invest that money in$
+such concerns as I shall indicate.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt use long words,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\How do you know I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to rob$
+you? Nobody‚M-^@M-^Ys ever trusted me with money before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He might have told her that she would not be trusted with a great deal$
+at a time and that she would be carefully watched. He preferred,$
+however, an explanation more flattering to his new assistant. And not$
+only was it flattering, but it contained a big grain of truth,$
+expressing, to an extent, Alfred Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys creed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Women are more honest than men,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I should think twice before$
+I put a man‚M-^@M-^Teven my best friend‚M-^@M-^Tin the position I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting you. It$
+will be a simple matter, and I shall pay you well. You can live at one$
+of the best hotels‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, it is absolutely necessary that you should.$
+You may‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\you may be Madam Benson, a rich Englishwoman.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him from under perplexed brows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the good of asking me to do that?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a tone of$
+disappointment. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were going to give me a job I could do.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Ym a fool at business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can remain a fool,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing to do except$
+carry out a certain routine, which I shall explain to you so that you$
+can‚M-^@M-^Yt possibly make a mistake. Here is a job which gives you plenty of$
+time, pays you well, gives you good clothes and an auto. Now, are you$
+going to be a sensible girl and take it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She thought a moment, then nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it means lunching here every day, I‚M-^@M-^Yll take it,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+Thus was formed the remarkable Benson Syndicate, about which so much has$
+been written, and so many theories evolved. For, if the truth be told,$
+the Benson Syndicate had no existence until Cartwright called it into$
+being in Ciro‚M-^@M-^Ys Restaurant. It was born of the opposition he had$
+received, and its creation was hastened by certain disquieting telegrams$
+which arrived almost every hour from London.$
+$
+Cartwright was, as has been said, a man of many interests. The$
+door-plate of his office in Victoria Street, London, was covered with$
+the names of the companies which had their headquarters in the ornate$
+suite which he occupied. There were two other suites of offices in the$
+City of London for which Mr. Cartwright paid the rent, although he did$
+not pay it in his own name. There were syndicates and companies$
+innumerable, Development Syndicates, Exploitation Companies, Financial$
+and Mining Companies, all duly registered and all keeping one solicitor$
+busy; for the Companies Acts are tricky, and Cartwright was too clever a$
+man to contravene minor regulations.$
+$
+And to all these companies there were shareholders; some of them$
+contented, some‚M-^@M-^Tthe majority‚M-^@M-^Twholly dissatisfied with their lot, and$
+quite a large number who were wont to show their share certificates to$
+their friends as curiosities, and tell them the sad story of how they$
+were inveigled into investment.$
+$
+Only a clever company lawyer can describe in detail the tortuous$
+character of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys system of finance. It involved loans from one$
+company to another, very often on the security of shares in a third$
+company; it involved a system of over-drafts, drawn in favour of some$
+weakly member of his family, secured by the assets of one which could$
+show a bold face to the world, and was even quoted in the Stock Exchange$
+list; and divers other complicated transactions, which only the expert$
+mathematician could follow.$
+$
+Cartwright was a rich man, accounted a millionaire by his friends; but$
+he was that type of millionaire who was never at a loss for a thousand,$
+but who was generally hard up for ten thousand. He came to London much$
+against his will, in response to an urgent telegram, and, having cleared$
+the difficulties which his subordinates had found insuperable, he had a$
+few hours to attend to his private affairs before he took the train back$
+to Paris.$
+$
+His secretary produced a heap of small bills requiring settlement, and$
+going through these, he paused before one printed slip, and frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That boy‚M-^@M-^Ys school fees weren‚M-^@M-^Yt paid last term,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said the secretary. ‚M-^@M-^\If you remember, I mentioned the matter$
+to you when you were in London last. I was taking upon myself the$
+responsibility of paying the fees, if you hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt returned. The boy is$
+coming up to-day, by the way, sir, to be measured for some clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Coming here?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Cartwright, interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright picked up the bill.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he read. ‚M-^@M-^\What does T. A. C. stand for‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XTake A$
+Chance‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understood he was named after you‚M-^@M-^TTimothy Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the secretary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes; of course,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright grinned. ‚M-^@M-^\Still, Take A Chance isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a bad$
+name for a kid. When is he arriving?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He ought to be here now,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, looking at his watch. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+out and see.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He disappeared into the outer office, and presently returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The boy is here, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Would you like to see him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bring him in,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to meet this nephew, or$
+cousin, or whatever he is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He wondered vaguely what had induced him to take upon himself the$
+responsibility of the small child, and with remorseless judgment$
+analysed the reason as being personal vanity.$
+$
+The door opened and a child strode in. ‚M-^@M-^\Strode‚M-^@M-^] is the only word to$
+describe the quick, decisive movement of the bright-eyed lad who looked$
+with unflinching eye at Cartwright. Cartwright did not look at his$
+clothes, but at the grey, clear eyes, the firm mouth, extraordinarily$
+firm for a boy of fourteen, and the capable and not over-clean hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, son,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\So you‚M-^@M-^Yre my nephew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cousin, I think,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, critically examining the contents of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys table. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre Cousin Alfred, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym a cousin, am I? Yes, I suppose I am,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amused.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, ‚M-^@M-^\is that the school bill? The Head has been$
+rather baity about that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\‚M-^@M-^XBaity‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys a new one on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shirty,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy calmly. ‚M-^@M-^\Annoyed, I suppose, is the correct$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to be?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A financier,‚M-^@M-^] said T. A. C. Anderson promptly.$
+$
+He seated himself, leant his elbow on the desk and his head on his hand,$
+his eyes never leaving Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that‚M-^@M-^Ys a great scheme‚M-^@M-^Tfinance,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym a whale at$
+mathematics.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What particular branch of finance?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Other people‚M-^@M-^Ys finance,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy promptly; ‚M-^@M-^\the same business as$
+yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright threw back his head and laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And do you think you‚M-^@M-^Yd be able to keep twenty companies in the air at$
+the same time?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the air?‚M-^@M-^] the boy frowned. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, you mean going all at once? Rather!$
+Anyway, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The phrase struck Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take a chance? That‚M-^@M-^Ys curious. I called you Take A Chance Anderson just$
+before you came in.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, they all call me that,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,$
+they‚M-^@M-^Yre bound to stick a label on to a fellow with an initial like mine.$
+Some of them call me ‚M-^@M-^XTin and Copper Anderson,‚M-^@M-^Y but most of them‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a rum kid,‚M-^@M-^] said his cousin. ‚M-^@M-^\You can come to lunch with me.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+                               CHAPTER IV$
+$
+$
+MR. ALFRED CARTWRIGHT had the enviable faculty of placing outside of$
+his mind all subjects and persons which were unpleasant to think upon.$
+Possessing this power, he could as lightly dismiss the memory of$
+responsibilities, pleasant or unpleasant. He had scarcely left London$
+before he had waived Master T. A. C. Anderson into oblivion. To do him$
+justice, he had certainly speculated vaguely upon assuring his cousin‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+future; but his mind was so completely occupied with his own that there$
+was really not room for both‚M-^@M-^Tand Take A Chance Anderson had to go.$
+$
+He reached Paris by the evening train, and drove straight to the$
+apartment he had taken for his new prot√©g√©. He found her installed in a$
+very comfortable flat on the unfashionable side of the Seine, and was$
+welcomed with relief.$
+$
+Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had not entirely overcome her suspicions of the _bona$
+fides_ of her newfound acquaintance. Yet, since he had not made love to$
+her, but, on the contrary, had made it very clear that the part he$
+expected her to play in his schemes involved no loss of self-respect,$
+she was becoming reconciled to a relationship which, to say the least,$
+was a strange one. She had established herself in a third-floor office$
+on one of the boulevards, an uncomfortable and unaccustomed figure in an$
+environment which was wholly foreign to her experience, though there was$
+no need for her embarrassment, since she constituted the whole of the$
+staff, and the callers were confined to the postman and the concierge$
+who acted as office-cleaner.$
+$
+She was to learn, however, that a daily attendance at her ‚M-^@M-^\bureau‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute the whole of her duties, or fulfil all Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+requirements.$
+$
+It was not until after dinner that night that Cartwright revealed$
+himself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sadie, my young friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, between puffs of his cigar, ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+going to tell you just what I want you to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought I knew,‚M-^@M-^] she said, on her guard, and he laughed softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll never quite know what I want you to do,‚M-^@M-^] he said frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\until$
+I tell you. Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting it to you very straight. I want nothing$
+from you except service. And the service I require is of a kind which$
+you need not hesitate to give me. You‚M-^@M-^Yre an actress, and I can speak to$
+you more plainly than I could to some unsophisticated girl.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She wondered what was coming, but had not long to wait.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will tell you something,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\which is really more important$
+than my name, about which you showed so much curiosity. There is a man$
+in this city whom I want to get at.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is a man who has it in his power to ruin me‚M-^@M-^Ta drunken sot of a$
+fellow, without brain or imagination.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He went on to explain briefly that he himself was a company promoter,$
+and that he had an interest in a mine, as yet unproved, in Morocco.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is why you were there?‚M-^@M-^] she nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is exactly why,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Unfortunately, right in the$
+midst of the ground which I have either bought or secured mineral rights$
+over, is a block of land which is the property of this man. He is a$
+Spaniard‚M-^@M-^Tdo you speak Spanish?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is precious little!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt matter,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright shook his head. ‚M-^@M-^\He speaks English very$
+well. Now, this land is absolutely valueless to the man, but every$
+attempt I have made to buy it has been unsuccessful, and it is vitally$
+necessary at this moment, when I am floating a company to develop the$
+property, that his claims should be included in my properties.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his name?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] repeated Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\I seem to have heard$
+that name before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is pretty common in France, but not so common in Spain,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr.$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And what am I to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will get you an introduction to him,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys a man$
+with a fine eye for beauty, and in the hands of a clever girl could be$
+wound round her little finger.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see what you mean,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but nothing doing!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have told you that it is necessary for me to$
+acquire this property. I am taking you into my confidence, and I know$
+that you will respect that confidence. I am willing to pay any$
+reasonable sum, and I neither want you to steal it nor make any personal$
+sacrifice to serve my ends. I am willing to pay, and pay heavily.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you call heavily?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl coolly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For the property twenty thousand‚M-^@M-^Tfor you ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^]$
+suggested Cartwright, and the girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys got me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Tell me what your plan is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My plan is this,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\You will appear to Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^TI$
+will arrange that‚M-^@M-^Tas a wealthy young American lady who has been$
+spending the winter in Morocco. His property follows a little wooded$
+hill, one of the prettiest formations of its kind in the Angera country.$
+You must rave about that hill, never cease speaking of its beauty and$
+its attractiveness; and you must tell him that you would give anything$
+in the world if you could build a house amidst that beautiful$
+scenery‚M-^@M-^Tdo you understand me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is a man somewhat susceptible to feminine charms,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright$
+went on, ‚M-^@M-^\and, unless I am greatly mistaken, he will in one of his$
+obliging moods, offer you the land at a nominal figure, particularly as$
+he has been bitterly disappointed in his attempt to find gold.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl after consideration. ‚M-^@M-^\You promised me$
+that if I came to Paris you would get me a job in one of the theatres.$
+That is what I am after, and the only thing I am fit for. The other$
+business doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt seem decent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds!‚M-^@M-^] murmured Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a lot,‚M-^@M-^] agreed the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but how am I coming out of this$
+business? I come out hopelessly compromised.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait a moment,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly; ‚M-^@M-^\let‚M-^@M-^Ys have a clear understanding.$
+You don‚M-^@M-^Yt expect me to walk up to Se√±or Brigot the first time I meet$
+him, or even the second, and say: ‚M-^@M-^XYou‚M-^@M-^Yve a very nice property. What$
+will you sell it for?‚M-^@M-^Y That is not the kind of transaction you expect me$
+to conduct, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means just a little more than you say,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\it means$
+dinners and suppers and hand-holdings and stringing him along. And after$
+it is all over, where am I? I‚M-^@M-^Yve got as much respect for my character as$
+you have for yours, Mr. Mysterious. I want to come out well in this$
+business as you do, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to leave my name behind, or be$
+known in Paris‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the world‚M-^@M-^Tas a decoy duck. I‚M-^@M-^Yd do an awful lot$
+to please you, because I like you and because you‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me.$
+But ‚M-^@M-^Xan awful lot‚M-^@M-^Y does not mean making me so cheap that I am left in$
+the slightly-soiled basket. Do you understand what I mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amazed at the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys cool reasoning. He$
+had not given her credit for any of these fine sentiments she now$
+enunciated, and he was piqued, and at the same time a little pleased.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When you said you‚M-^@M-^Yd give me ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+sounded good. But it is not good enough. I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea in the back of my$
+mind that the matter is a much bigger one for you than you‚M-^@M-^Yve told me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How big do you imagine?‚M-^@M-^] bantered Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think it is big enough to ruin you,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\and that$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yd be willing to pay any price to get this property. Otherwise, you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+go to the man or send your lawyer in the ordinary way. Now, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want$
+your ten thousand pounds, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to make a proposition to you.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve said I like you and that‚M-^@M-^Ys no more than the truth. You told me you$
+were a bachelor and I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you that I‚M-^@M-^Ym man-free and heart-free. I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt say I love you, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt flatter myself that you love me. But$
+if you want this thing to go through, and if you want me to go down in$
+the mud to get it, you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to pay the price‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And the price is‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to marry me,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright could only gasp his admiration; and then he$
+began to laugh, at first quietly, and then, as the humour of the$
+situation gained upon him, so loudly that the other patrons of the Caf√©$
+Scribe turned to look at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a rum idea,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, keeping her eyes on his.$
+$
+He nodded to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a bargain!‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She looked at him as she put out her hand and took his, and slowly shook$
+her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My!‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You want that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys land pretty badly, _I_ know!‚M-^@M-^]$
+and Cartwright began to laugh again.$

+$
+Se√±or Brigot lived in some style for a man who was on the verge of ruin.$
+He had a small house at Maisons Lafitte and a flat on the Boulevard$
+Webber. He was a heavy, tired-looking man, with a dark moustache,$
+obviously dyed, and a short beard, bearing evidence of the same$
+attention. M. Brigot, like Mr. Cartwright, had many interests; but his$
+chief interests were his own tastes and predilections. It was Se√±or$
+Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys boast that, although he had lived for twenty years in Paris, he$
+had never seen Paris between the hours of six in the morning and one in$
+the afternoon. His breakfast hour was two o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. By six o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the$
+evening he was becoming interested in life; and at the hour when most$
+people retire to rest, he was in the prime of his day.$
+$
+It happened on a certain evening that M. Brigot, who usually met dinner$
+in an amicable frame of mind, sat down at his favourite table at the$
+Abbaye with a big frown, and answered the polite _ma√Ætre d‚M-^@M-^Yh√¥tel‚M-^@M-^Ys_$
+cheery ‚M-^@M-^\Good evening‚M-^@M-^] with a snarl.$
+$
+Amongst his many enterprises and few possessions, and this Mr.$
+Cartwright did not know, was the proprietorship and management of a$
+small, ramshackle wooden theatre in the town of Tangier. He was likewise$
+interested in several cabarets throughout Spain. But what pained him$
+most at the moment was not distressing reports from any of these, but a$
+six-page letter received that afternoon from his son, in which the hope$
+of the house of Brigot had explained his reasons for discharging$
+immediately a very necessary servant. Therefore Se√±or Brigot swore under$
+his breath and cursed his first-born.$
+$
+Coincident with the arrival of the letter had come one Jose Ferreira,$
+who had been detained for a week at Madrid. Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys mind was$
+occupied with Jose Ferreira when that worthy, smirking apologetically,$
+as though conscious of the shabbiness of his dress-clothes, sidled into$
+a seat on the opposite side of the table. Se√±or Brigot glared at him a$
+moment, and Jose Ferreira shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had telegraphed to me, I would have settled the matter,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Brigot, as though carrying on a conversation which he had broken off a$
+few minutes before. ‚M-^@M-^\Instead, like the fool you are, you come all the$
+way to Paris, wasting your time in Madrid, and the first I hear of the$
+matter is from my son.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was deplorable,‚M-^@M-^] murmured Jose, ‚M-^@M-^\but Don Brigot‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot!‚M-^@M-^] sneered the father of that worthy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot is a$
+monkey! Why did you take notice of him? Have you nothing else to do in$
+Tangier but to look after that flea-ridden theatre? Have you no other$
+duties?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The young se√±or was emphatic,‚M-^@M-^] murmured the apologetic Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\He$
+demanded that I should leave and what could I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot grunted something uncomplimentary. Whether it was intended for$
+his son or for Ferreira, it was difficult to say. Ferreira was content$
+to take it to himself.$
+$
+Half-way through the dinner Brigot became more human.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will always be quarrels about women, my good Jose, and it is your$
+business to be diplomatic,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\My son is a fool; but then, all$
+young men are fools. Why should you neglect my interests because Emanuel$
+is a bigger fool than ever? Only this week I intended travelling to$
+Tangier with the representative of a very rich syndicate who wishes to$
+buy my land.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same se√±or as before?‚M-^@M-^] asked the interested Jose, who was not only$
+the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, but was also the representative of the$
+rusty little gold-mining company which Brigot had floated.$
+$
+The other nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same cursed Englishman,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Quite unconscious of the fact that his master was cursing the very man$
+whom Jose had most recently cursed, the little man smiled$
+sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I also have a hatred of the English,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\With what insolence do$
+they treat one!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+For some time M. Brigot sat in silence, but presently he wiped his mouth$
+on his napkin, tossed down a tumbler of red wine, and crooked his finger$
+at his companion, inviting closer attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a day, or perhaps two, I shall send you back to Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] began Jose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre‚M-^@M-^Tbah!‚M-^@M-^] exclaimed the other scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\A donkey-driver$
+could look after the theatre! It is the mine!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The mine?‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other in some astonishment.$
+$
+So long had it been since a spade had been put to the ground, so long$
+had those hopes of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys been apparently dead, that the very word$
+‚M-^@M-^\mine‚M-^@M-^] had ceased to be employed when referring to the property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My Englishman will buy it,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot confidently. ‚M-^@M-^\I happen to know$
+that he has taken up property in the neighbourhood, and he has already$
+made me an offer. But such an offer! He shall pay my price, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, nodding as he picked his teeth, ‚M-^@M-^\and it will be a big price,$
+because it is desirable that I should have money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose did not ask the price, but his employer saved him the trouble.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Five million pesetas,‚M-^@M-^] he said confidently; ‚M-^@M-^\for such a price the$
+property will be sold, always providing, my friend, that we do not$
+discover gold before the sale.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose smiled weakly, a circumstance which seemed to annoy his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot irritably; ‚M-^@M-^\you have no brains! You think$
+that is a preposterous sum? Wait!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When his subordinate‚M-^@M-^Ys dinner was finished, Jose was dismissed$
+peremptorily. Brigot had a round of calls to make, a succession of$
+people to be visited; and whilst he might interview the little man at$
+dinner without losing caste, he had no desire to take him round to his$
+usual haunts.$
+$
+It was at the Abbaye at that golden hour when the price of wine soars$
+and all that is smartest in Paris is assembled in the big saloon, that$
+M. Brigot, who had reached a stage of geniality, met an entrancing$
+vision. Brigot saw the girl and her cavalier at one of the tables, and$
+recognised in the latter a well-known man about town. The latter caught$
+his eye and walked across to him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is your charming companion?‚M-^@M-^] whispered Brigot, whose failing was,$
+as Cartwright accurately surmised, a weakness for pretty faces.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is an American lady who has just come from Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+glibly.$
+$
+Cartwright had chosen Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys companion very well. In a few$
+minutes Brigot had crossed to the other table and taken a seat, was$
+introduced, and was in that pleasant glow of mind which comes to the man$
+of his class who is conscious of having made an impression.$
+$
+This ‚M-^@M-^\American widow,‚M-^@M-^] with her queer, broken French, her beautiful$
+eyes, and the charming distinction which goes best with good clothes,$
+was more lovely than any woman he had ever met‚M-^@M-^Tso he swore to himself,$
+as he had sworn before. The friendship progressed from day to day, and$
+so great was the impression which the girl had made, that Brigot was$
+seen abroad at most unusual hours.$
+$
+The patient Jose Ferreira was despatched on a mission to Madrid, partly$
+because Brigot was tired of seeing him hanging about, and partly because$
+there was some genuine business to be done in the capital.$
+$
+Sadie reported progress to her employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, yes, he‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy enough about me,‚M-^@M-^] she said complacently, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going a little crazy myself. How long is this to go on?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another week?‚M-^@M-^] suggested Cartwright, smiling approvingly at the gloom$
+on the pretty face. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you mentioned the fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve taken a$
+fancy to his land?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wanted to give it to me there and then,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but you know$
+what these Spaniards are. If I had accepted, there would have been$
+nothing for me but the front door.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right,‚M-^@M-^] agreed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He is the kind of fish you must play.$
+Did he say anything about other offers he had received for the$
+property?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He spoke about you,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\he called you Benson‚M-^@M-^Tis that your real$
+name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is good enough,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is queer,‚M-^@M-^] mused the girl, looking at him thoughtfully, ‚M-^@M-^\that I$
+never meet any of your friends in Paris, and that nobody knows you‚M-^@M-^Tby$
+name. I went down to your flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+confessed frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\and asked the concierge. You‚M-^@M-^Yre Benson there too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In my business,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary that one should be discreet.$
+The name which goes in London is not good enough for Paris. And _vice$
+versa_,‚M-^@M-^] he added.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a strange man. I suppose if you marry me in the name of Benson$
+it will be legal?‚M-^@M-^] she asked dubiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it will be legal. I‚M-^@M-^Ym surprised at a girl of your$
+intelligence asking such a question,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What is the$
+programme for to-night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled a little face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Marigny and supper at Corbets‚M-^@M-^Tsupper in a private dining-room.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it‚M-^@M-^Ys come to that, has it? Well, you ought to make good to-night,$
+Sadie. Remember, I am willing to pay up to fifty thousand pounds. It is$
+going to be a tough job raising that money, and it will break my heart$
+to pay it. But it will not only break my heart, but it will break me$
+everlastingly and confoundedly to pay the man‚M-^@M-^Ys own price‚M-^@M-^Tand his$
+property must be bought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll do my best,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have no doubt in your mind$
+that it is going to be hard.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+At one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock the next morning he sat reading in his room, when a knock$
+came to his door and the girl came in. She was half hysterical, but the$
+light of triumph was in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it!‚M-^@M-^] he repeated in wonder. ‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean he sold?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For ten thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthree hundred thousand francs. What do you$
+think of your little Sadie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you serious?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+She hesitated and closed her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt talk about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have to see him to-morrow at$
+his lawyers, and the property will be transferred to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She smiled grimly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The after-part will not be as pleasant as M. Brigot imagines,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I tell you, that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy‚M-^@M-^Tstark, staring mad. But I felt$
+an awful beast, and I think he‚M-^@M-^Yll kill me when he discovers I‚M-^@M-^Yve sold$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that worry you,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright easily.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER V$
+$
+$
+HE saw the girl down to her waiting auto, and went back to his rooms$
+to think. It was curious that at that hour, when the big trouble on his$
+mind seemed likely to roll away, that his thoughts flew instantly to$
+Maxell. What would the prim Maxell say, if he knew? He was satisfied$
+that Maxell would not only disapprove, but would instantly and without$
+notice sever all connection with the adventurous company promoter.$
+Maxell would be outraged, appalled. Cartwright smiled at the thought.$
+$
+He was under no illusion as to his own conduct. He knew he was acting$
+despicably; but this view he dismissed from his mind as being too$
+unpleasant for contemplation. Maxell was a prig‚M-^@M-^Ta necessary prig, but$
+none the less priggish. He was necessary, at any rate, to Cartwright.$
+Anyway, Maxell stood to win if the scheme went through.$
+$
+Cartwright had reached nearly the end of his financial tether, and his$
+whole future was bound up in the success or failure of the new$
+promotion. He had exhausted every bit of his credit in order to take up$
+the Angera property which he knew was rich in gold, and offered$
+possibilities which no project of his had offered before.$
+$
+He had milked his other companies dry, he had played with reserves; all$
+except his Anglo-Parisian Finance Company, where the directors were too$
+strong to allow him his own way; and, although Maxell was not aware of$
+the fact, his ‚M-^@M-^\partner‚M-^@M-^] had spent fabulous sums, not only in acquiring$
+the land itself but in purchasing other gold-mining property in the$
+region. It was a gamble, and a dangerous gamble. He was risking the$
+substance of his fortune for the shadow of unlimited wealth.$
+$
+Yet, was it a risk? he asked himself; with the properties that he could$
+include in his new North Morocco Gold Mining Association‚M-^@M-^Tthat was to be$
+the title of the new company‚M-^@M-^Tthere could be no doubt as to the result$
+of the public issue. The British public dearly love a gamble, and a$
+gold-mining gamble, with all its mysteries and uncertainties, more$
+dearly than any.$
+$
+He went to bed late, but was taking his chocolate and roll before a$
+little caf√© on the boulevard before nine. At half-past nine he was$
+joined by the girl.$
+$
+Cartwright had been undecided as to whether he should take his _petit$
+d√©jeuner_ outside or inside the caf√©, and had decided, since the morning$
+was bright and warm, to breakfast under the striped awning in full view$
+of the street. Such great events hang upon slight issues.$
+$
+Scarcely had the girl seated herself opposite to him, when a pedestrian,$
+passing on the other side of the boulevard, halted and stared. Mr.$
+Ferreira had sharp eyes and a wit not altogether dulled by his$
+monotonous occupation.$
+$
+Cartwright produced a bulky package from his pocket and laid it on the$
+table before the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put that in your bag and be careful with it,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\there are three$
+hundred thousand francs in notes. When the property is transferred to$
+you, you must bring the transfer along to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about your promise?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I will keep,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that you have the best$
+guarantee in the possession of the transfer. Legally, it is your$
+property until it is made over to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She sat looking at the package absently, and presently she said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to get me out of Paris at once. Otherwise I am due to leave$
+by the Sud Express‚M-^@M-^Twith Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is a train for Havre at two-fifteen,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He saw her into her car‚M-^@M-^Tanother indiscretion since it brought him out$
+of the shadow which the awning afforded, and gave the observer on the$
+other side of the road an unmistakable view.$
+$
+Brigot was waiting for her‚M-^@M-^Ta heavy-eyed, weary-looking man, whose hand$
+shook whenever it rose to stroke his short, pointed beard.$
+$
+His lawyer watched him curiously as he stepped forward to meet the girl$
+with hands outstretched. It was not the first time that he had seen his$
+client overwhelmed by a pretty face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything is ready, Nanette,‚M-^@M-^] said the eager M. Brigot. (‚M-^@M-^\Nanette‚M-^@M-^] was$
+the newfound name which Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady employed for this adventure.) ‚M-^@M-^\See$
+here, I have all the documents ready!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I have the money,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the girl as she put the package down on$
+the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The money!‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Brigot waved such sordid matters out of existence$
+with a magnificent flourish. ‚M-^@M-^\What is money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Count it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will do no such thing,‚M-^@M-^] said the other extravagantly. ‚M-^@M-^\As a$
+caballero, it hurts me to discuss money in connection‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But his lawyer had no sentiment, and had slipped the string from the$
+package and was now busily counting the thousand-franc notes. When he$
+had finished, he put them on the desk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you one moment, M. Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Brigot, holding the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and devouring her with his eyes, turned$
+impatiently.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The document, my friend, the document! Give me a$
+pen!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is one point in the deed I must discuss,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer firmly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\if mademoiselle will excuse us for a moment‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He opened the door of$
+his inner office invitingly and with a shrug M. Brigot followed him in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have told you, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\that I do not think your$
+action is wise. You are surrendering a property for a sum less than a$
+quarter of what you paid for it to a perfectly unknown woman‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\M. l‚M-^@M-^YAvocat,‚M-^@M-^] said the other gravely, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a lady who$
+to me is more precious than life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer concealed a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have often spoken to you about ladies who have been more precious to$
+you than life,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly, ‚M-^@M-^\but in their cases, no transfer of$
+valuable property was involved. What do you know of this lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know nothing except that she is adorable,‚M-^@M-^] said the reckless$
+Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\But for the fact that, alas! my wife most obstinately refuses$
+to die or divorce me, I should be honoured to make madame my wife. As it$
+is, what a pleasure to give her the land on which to build a beautiful$
+villa overlooking my gorgeous Tangier‚M-^@M-^TI am moving to Tangier very soon$
+to look after my other property‚M-^@M-^Tand to know that her blessed$
+presence‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer spread out despairing hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then there is nothing to be done,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I only tell you that you$
+are transferring a valuable property to a lady who is comparatively$
+unknown to you, and it seems to me a very indiscreet and reckless thing$
+to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They returned again to the outer apartment, where the girl had been$
+standing nervously twisting the moir√© bag in her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is the document, madame,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer to her relief. ‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or$
+Brigot will sign here‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The indicated a line‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and you will sign there. I$
+will cause these signatures to be witnessed, and a copy of the document$
+will be forwarded for registration.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl sat down at the table, and her hand shook as she took up the$
+pen. It was at that moment that Jose Ferreira dashed into the room.$
+$
+He stood open-mouthed at sight of the girl at the table. He tried to$
+speak, but the sound died in his throat. Then he strode forward, under$
+the glaring eye of his employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This woman‚M-^@M-^Tthis woman!‚M-^@M-^] he gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] cried Brigot in a terrible voice, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a$
+lady who is my friend!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Tshe‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthe man pointed to her with shaking finger‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\she is the$
+woman! She escaped! . . . The woman I told you of, who ran away with an$
+Englishman from Tangier!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot stared from one to the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre mad,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is the woman,‚M-^@M-^] squeaked Ferreira, ‚M-^@M-^\and the man also is in Paris. I$
+saw them together this morning at the Caf√© Furnos! The man who was in$
+Tangier, of whom I told the se√±or, and this woman, Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot looked at the girl. She had been caught off her guard, and never$
+once had the keen eyes of the lawyer left her. Given some warning, she$
+might have dissembled and carried the matter through with a high hand.$
+But the suddenness of the accusation, the amazingly unexpected vision of$
+Jose, had thrown her off her guard, and Brigot did not need to look$
+twice at her to know that the charges of his subordinate were justified.$
+She was not a born conspirator, nor was she used to intrigues of this$
+character.$
+$
+Brigot gripped her by the arm and pulled her from the chair. He was half$
+mad with rage and humiliation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the name of this man?‚M-^@M-^] he hissed. ‚M-^@M-^\The name of the man who took$
+you from Tangier and brought you here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was white as death and terribly afraid.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson,‚M-^@M-^] she stammered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer and Brigot uttered the words together, and the Spaniard,$
+releasing his hold stepped back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it was Benson!‚M-^@M-^] he said softly. ‚M-^@M-^\Our wonderful Englishman who wanted$
+to swindle me out of my property, eh? And I suppose he sent you, my$
+beautiful American widow, to purchase land for your villa! Now, you can$
+go back to Mr. Benson and tell him that, if my property is good enough$
+for him to buy, it is good enough for me to keep. You‚M-^@M-^Tyou!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He made a dart at her with upraised hand, but the lawyer was before him$
+and gently pushed him back.$
+$
+He jerked his head to the girl and, shaking like a leaf, she stepped to$
+the door and went stumbling down the stairs, which she had mounted with$
+such confidence a few minutes before.$
+$
+Cartwright received the news with extraordinary equanimity.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has saved us the bother of going out of Paris,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\And it was my own fault. I never connected that infernal$
+fellow Ferreira with Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises. And anyway, we should not$
+have met in public. He said he saw us at the caf√©, did he?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did my best,‚M-^@M-^] she faltered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you did your best,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, patting her hand. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+tough luck, but it can‚M-^@M-^Yt be helped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was a long silence, then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about me?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Where do I come in? I suppose you have$
+no further use for my services?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course I have,‚M-^@M-^] he said genially. Then, after a longer pause, ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know that you‚M-^@M-^Yre the only person in this world that I have ever$
+taken so completely into my confidence and shown what, for a better$
+expression, I will call the seamy side of my business? I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to tell$
+you a lot more, because it would be a relief to me to get it off my$
+chest. But I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling you this, that if I marry you to-day, you‚M-^@M-^Yll have$
+to play your part to save me from everlasting ruin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ruin?‚M-^@M-^] she said, startled, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not the kind of ruin that means you‚M-^@M-^Yll go short of food,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but$
+the sort of ruin that may mean‚M-^@M-^Twell, ruin from my point of view. Now$
+you must understand this thing clearly, Sadie. I‚M-^@M-^Ym out for a big stake,$
+and if I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pull it off, it‚M-^@M-^Ys as likely as not that I‚M-^@M-^Yll go out.$
+You‚M-^@M-^Yre a clever, useful sort of kid, and I have an idea that you may be$
+even more useful. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys to be no sentiment in this marriage, mind!$
+You have just to sit here and hold tight and do as you‚M-^@M-^Yre told, and you$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got to pry into my business any further than I want you to. And$
+if I go away and don‚M-^@M-^Yt come back, you must reckon me as dead. I‚M-^@M-^Yve a lot$
+of business in America and elsewhere, which often takes me away for$
+months at a time, and you‚M-^@M-^Yre not to get uneasy. But if you don‚M-^@M-^Yt hear$
+from me‚M-^@M-^Twhy, you can go down to the Lafayette and buy yourself the$
+grandest little suit of mourning that you can afford!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I be able to afford it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall put some Rentes to your credit at the Lyonnais. That will give$
+you a steady income in case anything happens.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was troubled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite like this idea,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What will happen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Cartwright flicked away the ash from the end of his cigar and said$
+cheerfully:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That depends entirely upon the view which is taken of a certain$
+prospectus issued in London this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER VI$
+$
+$
+THE New Angera Syndicate was registered as a private company, and its$
+prospectus was not made public. Officially, the shares were not offered$
+to general subscription, and actually they had been subscribed‚M-^@M-^Tor the$
+first issue of five hundred thousand had‚M-^@M-^Tby a little group of shrewd$
+speculators in the City of London, who, before now, had made vast sums$
+from Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys promotions. The five hundred thousand shares brought$
+in about half that number of pounds, and nobody doubted that the$
+properties consolidated for the purposes of flotation included the block$
+of claims described in the prospectus as ‚M-^@M-^\lately the property of Se√±or$
+Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Gold had been found on the Angera reef, and gold in sufficient quantity$
+to make the new company a very promising speculation. That Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+property could be made to pay, had it been properly managed, was common$
+knowledge in the City of London. A dozen offers had been made for this$
+concession, but none had been quite acceptable to Se√±or Brigot, whose$
+estimate of the value of the mine varied with the passing hour.$
+$
+Probably, had it been possible to secure an interview with M. Brigot at$
+one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the afternoon, when he arose with a splitting head and a$
+dry throat, his possessions might have been acquired at the price of a$
+quart of sweet champagne.$
+$
+But, as the day progressed and his views of life became more charitable,$
+his estimate expanded until, by seven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the evening, which hour$
+he as a rule reserved for any business discussion, his figure was$
+awe-inspiring. Nobody in the City doubted for one moment that Cartwright$
+had purchased the property. Though his system of finance might not$
+commend itself to the barons and even the baronets of Capel Court, there$
+was no question of his honesty.$
+$
+Was it by some extraordinary fluke that Maxell, who had hitherto shared$
+in the profits of promotion, had kept aloof from this last and greatest$
+of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys flutters? No application for shares was ever found. He$
+heard (he said at a subsequent inquiry) in a round-about way of the$
+flotation, and saw a copy of the prospectus, and was a little worried.$
+He knew that when he had left Cartwright in Paris, not only was the$
+Brigot mine outside of his friend‚M-^@M-^Ys control, but there was precious$
+little prospect of bringing the Spaniard to a reasonable frame of mind.$
+$
+Cartwright must have done his work quickly, he thought, and have paid$
+heavily; and this latter reflection worried him even more because he had$
+a fairly accurate idea as to the condition of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private$
+finances. His private thoughts on this occasion are set forth in the$
+report of the Attorney-General‚M-^@M-^Ys Committee of Investigation.$
+$
+He was eating his solitary dinner in Cavendish Square when the telephone$
+bell rang and the voice of Sir Gregory Fane, the Attorney-General,$
+saluted him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should like to see you, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you come round to$
+Clarges Street after dinner?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Certainly,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell promptly, and hung up the receiver,$
+wondering what new difficulties had arisen, which called for a$
+consultation; for he was not on visiting terms with Mr. Attorney.$
+$
+In the tiny drawing-room of the house occupied by the Cabinet Minister,$
+Maxell was surprised to find another visitor waiting‚M-^@M-^Tno less a person$
+than Fenshaw, the Prime Minister‚M-^@M-^Ys private secretary.$
+$
+The Attorney-General came straight to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\we want your seat in the House of Commons.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The deuce you do!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, raising his eyebrows.$
+$
+The Attorney nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We also want to give you some reward for the excellent services you$
+have rendered to the Government,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But mostly‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This eyes$
+twinkled‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary to find a seat for Sir Milton Boyd‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+Minister of Education has been defeated at a by-election, as you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded. The communication was a surprise to him and he$
+wondered exactly what position was to be offered him which would involve$
+his resignation from the House. For one brief, panicky moment he had$
+connected Cartwright and his delinquencies with this request for an$
+interview, but the Attorney‚M-^@M-^Ys speech had dispelled that momentary fear.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quilland, as you know, has been raised to the Court of Appeal,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the Attorney, speaking of a well-known Chancery Judge, ‚M-^@M-^\and we are$
+departing from our usual practice by bringing over a man from the King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Bench to take his place. Now, Maxell, how does a judgeship appeal to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The K.C. could only stare.$
+$
+Of the many things he did not expect, it was elevation to the Bench,$
+although he was a sound, good lawyer, and the Bench is the ambition of$
+every silk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good!‚M-^@M-^] said the brisk Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\Then we will regard it as settled. The$
+appointment will not be announced for two or three days, so you‚M-^@M-^Yve a$
+chance of clearing up your more urgent work and preparing a letter for$
+your constituents. You might say a kind word for the new candidate who$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt particularly popular in your part of the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+One of Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys first acts was to write a letter to Cartwright. All$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys correspondence went to his London office, and was forwarded$
+under separate cover to Paris. It was a long letter, recapitulating$
+their friendly relationship, and ending:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This promotion, of course, means that we can no longer be$
+    associated in business, and I have instructed my broker to sell$
+    all the shares I possess in your and other companies forthwith.$
+    As you know, I have very definite views about the high prestige$
+    of the Bench; and whilst, in any circumstances, I feel that I$
+    can go to that dignified position with clean hands, my mind will$
+    be freer if I cut all the cords which hold me to commerce of$
+    every shape and description.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Three days later the letter came to Cartwright, and he read it through$
+with a thoughtful expression on his face. He read it twice before he$
+slowly folded it and put it into his inside pocket.$
+$
+Maxell was to be made a Judge!$
+$
+He had never considered that contingency, and did not know whether to be$
+pleased or sorry. He was losing the service of a man who had been a$
+directing force in his life, greater than Maxell himself ever imagined.$
+It was not so much the advice which he asked and received from the$
+King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel, but rather Cartwright had secured help by the simple$
+process of making a study of the other‚M-^@M-^Ys moods and expressions.$
+$
+He knew the half-frown which greeted some schemes, put forward$
+tentatively over the dinner table, and it was that little sign of$
+displeasure which could squash the scheme rather than any considered$
+advice which Maxell might have given. He was losing a good advocate, a$
+very sound legal adviser. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, it did not$
+matter very much. Fate had put a period to an old phase of life, and$
+many things had come to an end coincidently. He was taking his afternoon$
+tea when the letter had arrived, and the new Mrs. Cartwright marked with$
+interest the depression which followed the arrival of the mail.$
+$
+The new period was beginning excitingly, he thought. He had found a new$
+method of doing business, bolder and more desperate than any he had$
+attempted before; and with this development he had lost a man upon whom$
+he placed a great deal of reliance. Incidentally, he had just been$
+married, but this fact did not bulk very largely in his reckoning.$
+Maxell might serve him yet. The memory of an old business$
+partnership‚M-^@M-^Tfor in such an aspect did Cartwright interpret their$
+previous relationship‚M-^@M-^Tthe memory, too, of favours done, of financial$
+dangers shared, might serve him well if things went wrong. Maxell had a$
+pull with the Government‚M-^@M-^Ta greater pull, since he was now a Judge of$
+the Supreme Court.$
+$
+Maxell a Judge! It seemed queer. Cartwright had all the properly$
+constituted Englishman‚M-^@M-^Ys reverence for the Bench. In spite of much$
+experience in litigation, and an acquaintance with lawyers of all kinds$
+and stations, he reserved his awe for the god-like creature who sat in$
+wig and gown, and dispensed justice evenhandedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you had a worrying letter?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said, a little impatiently; ‚M-^@M-^\it is nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She had hoped for a glimpse of the envelope, but was disappointed.$
+Curiously enough, she ascribed the fact that her husband passed under a$
+strange name and would not divulge his own, to a cause which was far$
+from the truth, and was a great injustice to a man who, if he had not$
+given her his proper name, had given her a title to whatever name he$
+had. That thought she revealed for the first time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know what I think?‚M-^@M-^] she said unexpectedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you thought very much,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\In what particular$
+department of speculation does your mind wander?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] she answered. She was a little afraid of sarcasm,$
+as are all children and immature grown-ups. ‚M-^@M-^\It was about your name I$
+was thinking.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why the dickens don‚M-^@M-^Yt you leave my name alone?‚M-^@M-^] he snapped. ‚M-^@M-^\I have$
+told you that it is all for your good that I‚M-^@M-^Ym called Benson and known$
+as Benson in this town. When we go to London you will discover my name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know why you keep it dark.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why do I keep it dark?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, fixing his eyes on her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre married already.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her for a moment, and then burst into such a peal of$
+laughter that the girl knew her shot was wide of the mark.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a weird person,‚M-^@M-^] he said, getting up. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going out to see an$
+old friend of ours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of ours?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is the gentleman‚M-^@M-^Ys name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He won‚M-^@M-^Yt see you,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, won‚M-^@M-^Yt he?‚M-^@M-^] said the grim man. ‚M-^@M-^\I rather think he will.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot would not willingly have received one whose name was anathema,$
+but Cartwright got over the difficulty of his reception by the simple$
+process of sending up a card inscribed with the name of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys lawyer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You!‚M-^@M-^] spluttered M. Brigot, rising to his feet as the other entered the$
+room and closed the door behind him. ‚M-^@M-^\This is an outrage! It is$
+monstrous! You will leave this house immediately, or I will send for the$
+police!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, just keep quiet for a moment, Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, seating$
+himself coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see you as one business man to another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I refuse to discuss any business with you,‚M-^@M-^] stormed his unwilling host.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a scoundrel, a conspirator‚M-^@M-^Tbah! why do I talk to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre broke!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in calm, level tones, and he$
+used the Spanish word for ‚M-^@M-^\broke,‚M-^@M-^] which is so much more expressive than$
+any word in English.$
+$
+The conversation was carried on in this language, for Cartwright had an$
+intimate knowledge of its idioms and even of its patois.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your creditors in Paris are gathering round like hawks about a dead$
+cow. Your attempt to sell your Moorish property has been a failure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know a great deal,‚M-^@M-^] sneered Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Possibly you also know that I$
+am going to work the mine myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard that said of you for years,‚M-^@M-^] said he, ‚M-^@M-^\but the truth is,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre wholly incapable of working anything. You‚M-^@M-^Yre one of nature‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+little spenders‚M-^@M-^Tnow, Brigot, don‚M-^@M-^Yt let us quarrel. There is a time to$
+end feuds like ours, and this is that time. I am a business man, and so$
+are you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre as anxious to sell your property at a good price as I am$
+to buy it. I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to make you an offer.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot laughed sarcastically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded with gentle irony. ‚M-^@M-^\To build a house$
+for a beautiful American widow, eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright accepted the gibe with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to show you my hand,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will be infamously dirty,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot, who was in his bright six$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock mood.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know there is gold in the Angera,‚M-^@M-^] the other went on, without$
+troubling to notice the interruption, ‚M-^@M-^\and I know that, properly worked,$
+your mine may pay big profits.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will sell out,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot after consideration, ‚M-^@M-^\but at a price.$
+I have told you before I will sell out‚M-^@M-^Tat a price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But what a price!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, raising his eyebrows and with a$
+gesture of extravagant despair. ‚M-^@M-^\It is all the money in the world!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nevertheless, it is the price,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot comfortably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you what I am willing to do.‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright stroked his chin as$
+though the solution had just occurred to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I will float your$
+property in London, tacking on a number of other properties which I have$
+bought in the neighbourhood. I am willing to pay you two hundred$
+thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, six million francs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot was interested. He was so interested that, for the moment, he$
+could forget his animosity and private grievances. It was true that, as$
+Cartwright had said, his creditors were becoming noisy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In cash, of course?‚M-^@M-^] he said suddenly.$
+$
+Cartwright shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can have a portion in cash and the rest in shares.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] Brigot snapped his fingers. ‚M-^@M-^\I also can issue shares, my friend.$
+What are shares? Pieces of paper which are not worth their ink. No, no,$
+you deceive me. I thought you had come to me with a genuine offer. There$
+is no business to be done between you and me, Mr. Cartwright. Good$
+evening.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not move.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A portion in cash‚M-^@M-^Tsay, fifteen thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he suggested; ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+is a lot of money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To you‚M-^@M-^Tyes, but not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said the magnificent Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Give me$
+two-thirds in cash and I will take the rest in shares. That is my last$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This offer is open until‚M-^@M-^Twhen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Until to-morrow at this hour,‚M-^@M-^] replied Brigot.$
+$
+As Cartwright was going, a man tapped at the door. It was Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+‚M-^@M-^\secretary,‚M-^@M-^] who was also his valet. He handed a telegram to the$
+Spaniard, and Brigot opened and read. He was a long time digesting its$
+contents, and Cartwright waited for a favourable opportunity to say$
+good-bye. All the time his mind was working, and he thought he saw$
+daylight. Two-thirds of the money could be raised, and he could breathe$
+again.$
+$
+Presently Brigot folded up the telegram and put it in his pocket, and$
+there was on his face a beatific smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good night, Se√±or Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I will see you to-morrow$
+with the money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will have to be big money, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot, and there was a$
+note of exultation in his voice. ‚M-^@M-^\To buy my little property will cost$
+you half a million English pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know Solomon Brothers, the financiers of London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know them very well,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright steadily. He had good reason$
+to know Solomon Brothers, who had taken a large block of shares in his$
+new syndicate.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just had a telegram from Solomon Brothers,‚M-^@M-^] said Se√±or Brigot,$
+speaking slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and they ask me to give them the date when my property$
+was transferred to your syndicate. They tell me it is included in your$
+properties which you have floated. You know best, Mr. Cartwright,$
+whether my little mine is worth half a million English pounds to$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tespecially if I put a date agreeable to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blackmail, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright between his teeth, and without a word$
+left the room.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VII$
+$
+$
+HE went straight back to his flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army, and$
+the girl could see by his face that something had happened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might pack my bag, will you?‚M-^@M-^] he said almost brusquely. ‚M-^@M-^\I have a$
+letter or two to write. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to London. Important business has$
+arisen, and I may be gone some time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Wisely she asked no questions, but carried out his instructions. When$
+she came back from the room with a little gripsack packed, he was$
+blotting the envelope of the last letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Post these after I have gone,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I come down to the station and see you off?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The less you and I are seen together, the better, I think,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+with a faint smile.$
+$
+He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a cash-box. From this he$
+extracted a thick wad of notes, and, counting them rapidly, he tossed a$
+respectable bundle into her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may want this,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you have a regular income, but$
+you must keep in touch with the Lyonnais. For the moment I should advise$
+you to go to‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The looked at the ceiling for inspiration‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to Nice or$
+Monte Carlo. Keep away from the tables,‚M-^@M-^] he added humorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But‚M-^@M-^Tbut,‚M-^@M-^] said the bewildered girl, ‚M-^@M-^\for how long will you be gone?$
+Can‚M-^@M-^Yt I come with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is impossible,‚M-^@M-^] he said sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\You must go to the South of$
+France, leave by to-night‚M-^@M-^Ys train. Give your address to nobody, and take$
+another name if necessary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are things very wrong?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pretty bad,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry. I may be gone for a year, even$
+more. There are plenty of things you can do, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt go back into the$
+profession yet awhile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of taking up cinema work,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might do worse than go to America‚M-^@M-^Tif I am a long time gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stuffed the remainder of the notes into his pocket, picked up his$
+bag, and with no other farewell than a curt nod, left her.$
+$
+She was only to see him once again in her life-time.$
+$
+He crossed the Channel by the night boat and came to London in the early$
+hours of the morning. He drove straight away to his hotel, had a bath$
+and shaved. His plan was fairly well formed. Everything depended upon$
+the charity which Messrs. Solomon Brothers might display towards his$
+strange lapse.$
+$
+At breakfast he read in _The Times_ that ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Justice Maxell took his$
+seat upon the Bench‚M-^@M-^] on the previous day, and that paragraph, for some$
+reason, seemed to cheer him.$
+$
+At ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock he was in the City. At half-past ten he was interviewing$
+the senior partner of Solomon Brothers, a man with an expressionless$
+face, who listened courteously to the somewhat lame excuses which$
+Cartwright offered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was a mistake of a blundering clerk,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\As$
+soon as I discovered the error, I came back to London to withdraw all$
+the money which had been subscribed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a pity you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt come back yesterday, Mr. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Solomon.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\that we have already placed this matter in$
+the hands of our solicitors. I suggest that you had better interview$
+them.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright made a further pilgrimage to the solicitors of Solomon$
+Brothers, and found them most unwilling to see him. That was an ominous$
+sign, and he went back to his office in Victoria Street conscious that a$
+crisis was at hand. At any rate, the girl was out of the way; but, what$
+was more important, she, one of the principal witnesses in so far as$
+Brigot and his property were concerned, was not available for those who$
+might bring a charge against him. She was his wife, and her lips were$
+sealed, and this consequence of his marriage was one which he had not$
+wholly overlooked when he had contracted his strange alliance.$
+$
+What a fool he had been! The property might have been transferred and in$
+his hands, if he had not antagonised a wretched little Spanish$
+theatrical manager. But, he reflected, if he had not antagonised that$
+manager, he would not have possessed the instrument for extracting the$
+transfer from the amorous Brigot.$
+$
+At the top of a heap of letters awaiting him was one written in a firm$
+boyish hand, and Cartwright made a little grimace, as though for the$
+first time recognising his responsibility.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson; my lad, you will have to take a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and pushed the letter aside unopened.$
+$
+He lunched at his club, sent a brief letter to Maxell, and returned to$
+his office at two in the afternoon. His clerk told him that a man was$
+waiting for him in the inner office. Cartwright hesitated with his hand$
+on the door; then, setting his teeth, he stepped in.$
+$
+The stranger rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you Mr. Alfred Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is my name,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am Inspector Guilbury, of the City Police,‚M-^@M-^] said the stranger, ‚M-^@M-^\and I$
+shall take you into custody on charges under the Companies Act, and a$
+further charge of conspiracy to defraud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go ahead,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+All the week preceding the trial, Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys heart was filled with$
+warm, gratitude to his erstwhile friend. He did not doubt, when his$
+solicitor told him that Mr. Justice Maxell would try his case, that$
+Maxell had gone a long way out of his way to get himself appointed the$
+Old Bailey judge. How like Maxell it was‚M-^@M-^Tthat queer, solemn stick‚M-^@M-^Tand$
+how loyal!$
+$
+Cartwright had a feeling for Maxell which he had never had before. At$
+first he had feared the embarrassment which might be Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys at having$
+to try a case in which an old friend was implicated, and had even hoped$
+that the new judge would have nothing to do with the trial. He did not$
+despair of Maxell pulling strings on his behalf, and he realised that$
+much could be done by judicious lobbying.$
+$
+The charge against him was a grave one. He had not realised how serious$
+it was until he had seen that respectful array of counsel in the Lord$
+Mayor‚M-^@M-^Ys Court, and had heard his misdemeanours reduced to cold legal$
+phraseology. But he did not wholly despair. Brigot had been coming to$
+London to give evidence, and on his journey there had occurred an$
+incident which suggested to the accused man that Providence was fighting$
+on his side. The Spaniard had had a stroke in the train to Calais, and$
+the doctors reported that he might not recover. Not that Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+evidence was indispensable. There was, apparently, a letter and two$
+telegrams in existence, in the course of which Brigot denied that he had$
+ever parted with his property; and the onus lay upon Cartwright to prove$
+that he had acted in a _bona fide_ manner‚M-^@M-^Tthat was impossible of proof,$
+and nobody knew this better than Cartwright.$
+$
+And ever his mind reverted to the singular act of generosity on the part$
+of his old friend. He did not doubt for one moment that Maxell had$
+‚M-^@M-^\worked‚M-^@M-^] the case so that it fell to him to try it.$
+$
+It was a bright morning in May when he came up the steps of the Old$
+Bailey and took his place in the dock. Almost immediately after, the$
+Judge and the Sheriff entered from the door behind the plain oaken$
+bench. How well the judicial robes became Maxell, thought Cartwright. He$
+bowed slightly and received as slight a bow in reply. Maxell was looking$
+pale. His face was drawn, and there was resolution in his speech and in$
+his eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before this case proceeds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I wish to direct attention to a$
+statement in one of the newspapers this morning, that I was associated$
+with the accused in business, and that I am in some way involved,$
+directly or indirectly, in the company promotion‚M-^@M-^Teither as a$
+shareholder or an indirect promoter‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the subject of the present$
+charge. I wish to utter an emphatic denial to that statement.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He spoke clearly and slowly and looked the prisoner straight in the eye,$
+and Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can only endorse your lordship‚M-^@M-^Ys statement,‚M-^@M-^] he said emphatically.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your lordship has never had any dealings with me or any business$
+transactions whatsoever.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a minor sensation which provided a headline for the evening$
+newspapers. The case proceeded. It was not particularly involved and the$
+witnesses were few but vital. There were those business men who had$
+subscribed or promised to subscribe to the syndicate. There was Mr.$
+Solomon, who could give an account of his dealings with the prisoner.$
+But, most damning of all, was a sworn statement made by Brigot before an$
+English solicitor, a Commissioner of Oaths. And it was such a statement$
+which only documentary proof, produced by the accused man, could refute.$
+$
+Cartwright listened to the evidence untroubled of mind. He knew that his$
+counsel‚M-^@M-^Ys speech, delivered with such force, was little less than an$
+admission of guilt and a plea for mercy. The last word would be with the$
+judge. A verdict of ‚M-^@M-^\guilty‚M-^@M-^] there must necessarily be. But he thought$
+that, when later his counsel pleaded for a minimum sentence, he saw a$
+responsive look in the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+The stigma of imprisonment did not greatly distress Cartwright. He had$
+lived on the narrow border-line of illegalities too long; he had weighed$
+chances and penalties too nicely to bother about such ephemeral things$
+as ‚M-^@M-^\honour.‚M-^@M-^] His system of finance was reviewed, and certain minor$
+charges arising out of the manipulation of funds were gone into. It was$
+late in the evening when the Judge began his summing up.$
+$
+It was a fair, if a conventional address he delivered to the jury.$
+Obviously, thought Cartwright, he could do nothing less than call$
+attention to the serious nature of the charge, the interests involved,$
+the betrayal of shareholders, and the like. On the whole, the summing up$
+did not diminish the comforting sense that the worst that lay before him$
+was a few months‚M-^@M-^Y imprisonment and then a start in another land under$
+another name. He never doubted his ability to make money. The summing up$
+was ended, and the jury retired. They were gone twenty minutes, and when$
+they came back it was a foregone conclusion what their verdict would be.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Guilty,‚M-^@M-^] was the reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And is that the verdict of you all?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Justice Maxell was examining his notes, and presently he closed the$
+little book which he was consulting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The charge against Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is one of the most$
+serious which could be brought against a business man. The jury have$
+returned a verdict of guilty, and I must say that I concur in that$
+verdict. I am here in my place‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This voice shook a little‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to$
+administer and maintain the laws of England. I must do all that in me is$
+possible to preserve the purity of commercial life and the condition of$
+English commercial honesty.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright waited for that ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tit did not come.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In view of the seriousness of the frauds and irregularities which the$
+accused has committed, with a cynical disregard for the happiness or$
+fortune of those people whose interests should have been his own, I$
+cannot do less than pass a sentence which will serve as an example to$
+all wrongdoers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped and gripped the edge of the dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You, Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, and again looked him straight in$
+the eye, ‚M-^@M-^\will be kept in penal servitude for twenty years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright swallowed something. Then he leaned across the edge of the$
+dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You swine!‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily, and then the warders dragged him away.$
+$
+Two days later there was a new sensation. The newspapers announced that$
+Mr. Justice Maxell had been compelled, on account of ill-health, to$
+resign from the Bench, and that His Majesty had been pleased to confer a$
+baronetcy of the United Kingdom upon the ex-Judge.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VIII$
+$
+$
+SOME nine years after the events detailed in the last chapter, a$
+fairly clever young actress who had drifted into the cinematograph$
+business, faced one of the many disappointments which had made up her$
+life. In many ways the disappointment was more bitter than any she had$
+previously experienced, because she had banked so heavily upon success.$
+$
+If there was any satisfaction to be had out of the new tragedy it was to$
+be found in the fact that the fault was not entirely hers. An impartial$
+critic might, indeed, absolve her from all responsibility.$
+$
+In this particular instance she regarded herself in the light of a$
+martyr to indifferent literature‚M-^@M-^Tnot without reason.$
+$
+When the Westminster Art Film Company was tottering on its last legs,$
+Mr. Willie Ellsberger, chairman and chief victim, decided on one big$
+throw for fortune. The play decided upon does not matter, because it was$
+written by Willie himself, with the assistance of his advertising man,$
+but it contained all the stunts that had ever got by in all the photo$
+plays that had ever been produced, and in and out of every breathless$
+situation flashed Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, the most amazing, the most charming,$
+the most romantic, the highest salaried artiste that filmland had ever$
+known.$
+$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had come to London from Honolulu, after she had inherited$
+her father‚M-^@M-^Ys considerable fortune. She came, a curious visitor, to the$
+studios, merely as a spectator, and had laughingly refused Mr.$
+Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys first offer, that gentleman having been attracted by her$
+perfect face and the grace of her movements; but at last, after$
+extraordinary persuasion, she had agreed to star in that stupendous$
+production, ‚M-^@M-^\The Soul of Babylon,‚M-^@M-^] for a fee of ¬£25,000, which was to be$
+distributed amongst certain Honolulu charities in which she was$
+interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] she told a newspaper man, ‚M-^@M-^\this is to be my first and my last$
+film. I enjoy the work very much, but naturally it takes up a great deal$
+of my time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you returning to Honolulu?‚M-^@M-^] asked our representative.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] replied Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, ‚M-^@M-^\I am going on to Paris. My agent has bought$
+me the Duc de Montpelier‚M-^@M-^Ys house in the Avenue d‚M-^@M-^YEtoile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A week after the picture was finished, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady waited on the$
+chairman by appointment.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] said that gentleman, leaning back in his chair, and$
+smiling unhappily, ‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a flivver!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We ran it off for the big renter from the North, and he says it is$
+about as bad as it can be, and that all the good in it is so obviously$
+stolen, that he dare not risk the injunction which would follow the$
+first exhibition. Did Simmonds pay you your last week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, Mr. Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Ellsberger shrugged.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sets me back another twenty pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said and reached for his$
+cheque-book. ‚M-^@M-^\It is tough on you, Sadie, but it‚M-^@M-^Ys tougher on us. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+so sure that it is so tough on you, though. I spent a fortune$
+advertising you. There isn‚M-^@M-^Yt anybody in this country who hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt heard of$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and,‚M-^@M-^] he added grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yve more publicity than I hope$
+I shall get when this business goes into the hands of the Official$
+Receiver.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So there‚M-^@M-^Ys no more work?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl after a pause.$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys hands said: ‚M-^@M-^\What can I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You ought not to have any difficulty in getting a shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\with$
+your figure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Especially when the figure‚M-^@M-^Ys twenty pounds a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+unsmilingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I was a fool ever to leave Paris. I was doing well there$
+and I wish I‚M-^@M-^Yd never heard of the cinema business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Still young and pretty and slim, with a straight nose and a straighter$
+mouth, she had no appeal for Mr. Ellsberger, who in matters of business$
+had an unsympathetic nature.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you go back to Paris?‚M-^@M-^] he said, speaking very deliberately$
+and looking out of the window. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps that affair has blown over by$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What affair?‚M-^@M-^] she asked sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve friends in Paris,‚M-^@M-^] said the chairman, ‚M-^@M-^\good, bright boys who go$
+around a lot, and they know most of what‚M-^@M-^Ys going on in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, biting her lips thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Reggie van Rhyn‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble you heard about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what happened, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll never believe in a thousand years$
+that I stabbed him,‚M-^@M-^] she said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been too much of$
+a lady for that sort of thing‚M-^@M-^TI was educated at a convent.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger yawned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take that to Curtis, will you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\If he can get any free$
+publicity for you, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yll be glad. Now take my advice‚M-^@M-^Tstay on. I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+put Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady way up amongst the well-known products of Movieland,$
+and you‚M-^@M-^Yll be a fool if you quit just when the public is getting$
+interested in you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym in bad, but that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt affect you, Sadie, and$
+there ain‚M-^@M-^Yt a producer in England who wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt jump at you and give you$
+twice the salary I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She stood up, undecided. Ellsberger was growing weary of the interview.$
+He made a great show of pulling out notepaper and rang the bell for his$
+stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The publicity‚M-^@M-^Ys fine,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yve felt good about the$
+work. Why the letters that I‚M-^@M-^Yve had from people asking for my autograph$
+and pictures of my Honolulu estate‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe smiled a little$
+frostily‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\people in society, too. Why, a titled man who wrote to me$
+from Bournemouth, Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger was interested, indeed, he was fascinated. He waved away$
+his stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre sure it was Maxell? Sir John$
+Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys class there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And there‚M-^@M-^Ys money, too,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+get in touch with him, Sadie? A fellow like that would think nothing of$
+putting ten thousand into a picture if he was interested in a girl. If$
+you happen to be the girl, Sadie, there‚M-^@M-^Yll be a thousand pound contract$
+for you right away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Her straight lips were a trifle hard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you want is an angel, and the Judge is the best kind of angel you$
+could wish for.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has he got money?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] said the hands of Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\What a ridiculous question to$
+ask!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] he scoffed. ‚M-^@M-^\Money to burn. Do you mean to say you‚M-^@M-^Yve never$
+heard of Sir John Maxell, never heard of the man who sent his best$
+friend to gaol for twenty years? Why, it was the biggest sensation of$
+the year!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sadie was not very interested in history, but momentarily, by virtue of$
+the very warm and well punctuated letter which reposed in her bag, she$
+was interested in Sir John.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is he married?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl naturally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is not married,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger emphatically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Any children?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no children, but he has a niece‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got some legal$
+responsibility as regards her; I remember seeing it in the newspapers,$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys her guardian or something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger looked at the girl with a speculative eye.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you his letter?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded and produced the epistle.$
+$
+It was polite but warm. It had some reference to her ‚M-^@M-^\gracious talent,‚M-^@M-^]$
+to her ‚M-^@M-^\unexampled beauty‚M-^@M-^] which had ‚M-^@M-^\brought pleasure to one who was no$
+longer influenced by the commonplace,‚M-^@M-^] and it finished up by expressing$
+the hope that they two would meet in the early future, and that before$
+leaving for Paris she would honour him by being his guest for a few$
+days.$
+$
+Ellsberger handed the letter back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Write him,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and, Sadie, consider yourself engaged for another$
+week‚M-^@M-^Twrite to him in my time. He‚M-^@M-^Ys fallen for all that Press stuff, and$
+maybe, if he‚M-^@M-^Ys got that passionate admiration for your genius$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll‚M-^@M-^Tsay, you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to stay in the picture business and finish by$
+marrying that kind of trouble, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pointed through the wide windows to a youth who was coming across$
+from the studio to the office, swinging a cane vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Observe the lavender socks and the wrist watch,‚M-^@M-^] he chuckled. ‚M-^@M-^\But$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt make any mistake about Timothy Anderson. He‚M-^@M-^Ys the toughest amateur$
+at his weight in this or any other state and a good boy, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+kind of fellow that women like you marry‚M-^@M-^Tget acquainted with the$
+Judge.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+With only a preliminary knock, which he did not wait to hear answered,$
+the young man had swung through the door, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do, Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I saw your picture‚M-^@M-^Tfine! Good acting,$
+but a perfectly rotten play. I suppose you wrote it, Ellsberger?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wrote it,‚M-^@M-^] admitted that gentleman gloomily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It bears the impression of your genius, old bird.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson shook his head reproachfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It only wanted you as the leading man, and it would have been dead$
+before we put the titles in,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger with a grin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of the movies for good,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy Anderson, sitting himself$
+on a table. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a demoralising occupation‚M-^@M-^Twhich reminds me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped from the table, thrust his hand into his pocket, and$
+producing a roll of notes:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I owe you twenty-five pounds, Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Thank you very$
+much. You saved me from ruin and starvation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He counted the money across, and Mr. Ellsberger was undoubtedly$
+surprised and made no attempt to conceal the fact. So surprised was he$
+that he could be jocose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Fixed a big contract with Mary Pickford?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\N-no,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I struck a roulette game‚M-^@M-^Tand took a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Took a chance again, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\One of these days you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+take a chance and never get better of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pooh!‚M-^@M-^] said the other in derision. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you think that‚M-^@M-^Ys any new$
+experience for me? Not on your life. I went into this game with just$
+twelve pounds and my hotel bill three weeks in arrears. I was down to my$
+last half-crown, but I played it and came out with three hundred$
+pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Whose game was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Ellsberger curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tony Smail,‚M-^@M-^] and Mr. Ellsberger whistled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, that‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the toughest places in town,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a$
+wonder you came away with the money‚M-^@M-^Tand your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I took a chance,‚M-^@M-^] said the other carelessly, and swung his legs once$
+more over the edge of the desk. ‚M-^@M-^\There was some slight trouble when I$
+came out of Smail‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] he shrugged his shoulders, ‚M-^@M-^\just a little$
+horseplay.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had followed the conversation keenly. Any talk which circled$
+about finance had the effect of concentrating her attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you always take a chance?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Always,‚M-^@M-^] said the other promptly.$
+$
+This woman did not appeal to him. Timothy possessed a seventh sense$
+which he called his ‚M-^@M-^\Sorter,‚M-^@M-^] and Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady was already sorted$
+into the heap of folks who, had life been a veritable voyage, would have$
+been labelled ‚M-^@M-^\Not Wanted.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going by the next boat to New York,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\then I‚M-^@M-^Yll go to$
+California. Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll take in Kempton on my way, for a fellow I met at$
+the hotel has a horse running which can catch pigeons. Good-bye, Miss$
+O‚M-^@M-^YGrady. I wish you every kind of luck.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She watched him disappear, sensing his antagonism and responding$
+thereto. If he could judge women by intuition, she judged him by reason,$
+and she knew that here was a man whose mental attitude was one of$
+dormant hostility.$
+$
+It would be unfair to her to say that it was because she recognised the$
+clean mind and the healthy outlook and the high principles of this young$
+man that she disliked him. She was not wholly bad, because she had been$
+the victim of circumstances and had lately lived a two-thousand pound$
+life on a one-hundred pound capacity. She looked after him, biting her$
+lips as though she were solving a great problem.$
+$
+Presently she turned to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll write to Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+By a curious coincidence Timothy Anderson had the idea of approaching$
+Sir John Maxell also, though nearly a year passed before he carried his$
+idea into execution.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER IX$
+$
+$
+THE initials ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] before young Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood for$
+Timothy Alfred Cartwright, his pious but practical parent having, by$
+this combination, made a bid for the protection of the saints and the$
+patronage of Cousin Al Cartwright, reputedly a millionaire and a$
+bachelor. It was hoped in this manner that his position on earth and in$
+heaven would be equally secure.$
+$
+What Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chances are in the hereafter the reader must decide; but$
+we do know that Cousin Al Cartwright proved both a weak reed and a$
+whited sepulchre. Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys parents had departed this life two years$
+after Alfred Cartwright had disappeared from public view, leaving behind$
+him two years‚M-^@M-^Y work for a committee of Investigating Accounts.$
+$
+When his surviving parent died, the boy was at school, and if he was not$
+a prodigy of learning he was at least brilliant in parts.$
+$
+Though it was with no great regret that he left school, he was old$
+enough and shrewd enough to realise that a bowing acquaintance with the$
+differential calculus, and the ability to conjugate the verb ‚M-^@M-^\avoir‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute an equipment, sufficiently comprehensive (if you will$
+forgive these long words), to meet and defeat such enemies to human$
+progress as he was likely to meet in this cruel and unsympathetic world.$
+$
+He had a small income bequeathed by his mother in a will which was$
+almost apologetic because she left so little, and he settled himself$
+down as a boarder in the house of a schoolmaster, and took up those$
+branches of study which interested him, and set himself to forget other$
+branches of education which interested him not at all.$
+$
+Because of his ineradicable passion for challenging fate it was only$
+natural that ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] should bear a new significance, and since some$
+genius had christened him ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson the name stuck. And$
+he took chances. From every throw with fate he learnt something. He had$
+acquired some knowledge of boxing at school, and had learnt enough of$
+the art to enable him to head the school. Such was his faith in himself$
+and his persuasive eloquence that he induced Sam Murphy,$
+ex-middle-weight and proprietor of the Stag‚M-^@M-^Ys Head, Dorking, to nominate$
+and support him for a ten-rounds contest with that redoubtable$
+feather-weight, Bill Schenk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson took his chance. He also took the count in the$
+first round, and, returning to consciousness, vowed a vow‚M-^@M-^Tnot that he$
+would never again enter the ring, but that he would learn something more$
+of the game before he did. Of course, it was very disgraceful that a man$
+of his antecedents should become a professional boxer‚M-^@M-^Tfor professional$
+he became in the very act of failure‚M-^@M-^Tbut that worried him not at all.$
+$
+It is a matter of history that Bill Schenk was knocked out by Kid$
+Muldoon, and that twelve months after his initiation into the prize ring$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. Anderson‚M-^@M-^] fought twenty rounds with the Kid and got the decision on$
+points. Thereafter, the ring knew ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson no more.$
+$
+He took a chance on race-courses, backing horses that opened at tens and$
+closed at twenties. He backed horses that had never won before on the$
+assumption that they must win some time. He had sufficient money left$
+after this adventure to buy a book of form. He devoted his undoubted$
+talent to the study of other games of chance. He played cards for$
+matches with a broker‚M-^@M-^Ys clerk, who harboured secret ambitions of going$
+to Monte Carlo with a system; he purchased on the hire system$
+wonderfully cheap properties on the Isle of Thanet‚M-^@M-^Tand he worked.$
+$
+For all his fooling and experimenting, for all his gambling and his$
+chancing, Timothy never let a job of work get past him, if he could do$
+it, and when he wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt working for sordid lucre he was working for the$
+good of his soul. He went to the races with a volume of Moli√®re‚M-^@M-^Ys plays$
+under his arm, and between events he read, hereby acquiring the respect$
+of the racing fraternity as an earnest student of form.$
+$
+So he came by violent, yet to him easy, stages to Movieland‚M-^@M-^Tthat Mecca$
+which attracts all that is enterprising and romantic and restless. He$
+took a chance in a juvenile lead, but his method and his style of$
+actions were original. Producers are for ever on the look out for$
+novelty, but they put the bar up against novel styles of acting and$
+expression. Ellsberger had tried him out because he had known his$
+father, but more because he had won money over him when he had beaten$
+Kid Muldoon; but even Ellsberger was compelled to suggest that Timothy$
+put in two long years ‚M-^@M-^\atmosphering‚M-^@M-^] before he essayed an individual$
+r√¥le on the screen.$
+$
+Timothy was not certain whether his train left at ten minutes to seven$
+or at ten minutes past seven, so he arrived in time for the ten minutes$
+to seven, which was characteristic of him, because he never took a$
+chance against the inflexible systems.$
+$
+He reached New York without misadventure, but on his way westward he$
+stayed over at Nevada. He intended spending a night, but met a man with$
+a scheme for running a mail-order business on entirely new lines,$
+invested his money, and by some miracle managed to make it last a year.$
+At the end of that time the police were after his partner, and Timothy$
+was travelling eastward by easy stages.$
+$
+He came back to New York with fifty-five dollars which he had won from a$
+Westerner on the last stage of the journey. The track ran for about$
+twenty miles along the side of the road, the wager between them was a$
+very simple one; it was whether they would pass more men than women on$
+the road. The Westerner chose men and Timothy chose women. For every man$
+they saw Timothy paid a dollar, for every woman he received a dollar. In$
+the agreed hour they passed fifty-five more women than they passed men$
+and Timothy was that many dollars richer. There were never so many women$
+abroad as there were that bright afternoon, and the Westerner couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+understand it until he realised that it was Sunday‚M-^@M-^Ta fact which Timothy$
+had grasped before he had made his wager.$
+$
+Two months later he was back in London. How he got back he never$
+explained. He stayed in London only long enough to fit himself up with a$
+new kit before he presented himself at a solid mansion in Branksome$
+Park, Bournemouth. Years and years before, Sir John Maxell had written$
+to him, asking him to call upon him for any help he might require, and$
+promising to assist him in whatever difficulties he might find himself.$
+Timothy associated the offer with the death of his father‚M-^@M-^Tmaybe they$
+were friends.$
+$
+He was shown into the sunny drawing-room bright with flowers, and he$
+looked round approvingly. He had lived in other people‚M-^@M-^Ys houses all his$
+life‚M-^@M-^Tschools, boarding-houses, hotels and the like‚M-^@M-^Tand an atmosphere$
+of home came to him like the forgotten fragrance of a garden he had$
+known.$
+$
+The servant came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will see you in ten minutes, sir, but you must not keep him$
+long, because he has to go out to meet Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in surprise, ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know he was$
+married.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant smiled and said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Judge married a year ago, sir. It was in all the newspapers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt read all the newspapers,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt sufficient$
+time. Who was the lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man looked round, as if fearing to be overheard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John married the cinema lady, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and the$
+hostility in his tone was unmistakable.$
+$
+Timothy gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, that beats the band! Why, I knew that$
+da‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T, that lady in London!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant inclined his head sideways.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Indeed, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and it was evident that he did not regard$
+Timothy as being any fitter for human association by reason of his$
+confession.$
+$
+A distant bell buzzed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John is ready, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I hope you will not mention the fact$
+that I spoke of madam?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy winked, and was readmitted to the confidence of the democracy.$
+$
+Sir John Maxell was standing up behind his writing table, a fine, big$
+man with his grey hair neatly brushed back from his forehead and his$
+blue eyes magnified behind rimless glasses.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, coming round the table with slow steps.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely this is not the little Timothy I heard so much about years and$
+years ago!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is I, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I should never have known you. Sit down, my$
+boy. You smoke, of course‚M-^@M-^Teverybody smokes nowadays, but it seems$
+strange that a boy I knew in short breeches should have acquired the$
+habit. I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said, as Timothy lit his cigar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing to my discredit, I hope, sir?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he repeated diplomatically, ‚M-^@M-^\let it go at$
+that. Now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve come here because, five years ago, on the$
+twenty-third of December to be correct, I wrote to you, offering to give$
+you any help that lay in my power.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I won‚M-^@M-^Yt swear to the date,‚M-^@M-^] said Tim.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But I will,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the other. ‚M-^@M-^\I never forget a date, I never forget a$
+letter, I never forget the exact wording of that letter. My memory is an$
+amazing gift. Now just tell me what I can do for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I have had a pretty bad time in America. I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+running in a team with a crook and I‚M-^@M-^Yve had to pay out every cent I had$
+in the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded slowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then it is money you want,‚M-^@M-^] he said, without enthusiasm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly money, sir, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to try to start in London and I$
+thought, maybe, you might give me a letter of introduction to somebody.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, brightening up, ‚M-^@M-^\I think I can do that for you.$
+What did you think of doing in London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of getting some sort of secretarial job,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Not that$
+I know much about it!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John pinched his lower lip.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know a man who may help you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We were in the House of$
+Commons together and he would give you a place in one of his offices,$
+but unfortunately for you he has made a great deal of money and spends$
+most of his time at Newmarket.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds good to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance$
+there. Perhaps he‚M-^@M-^Yd try me out in that office?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Judge permitted himself to smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In Newmarket,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\our friend does very little more, I fear, than$
+waste his time and money on the race-course. He has half a dozen$
+horses‚M-^@M-^TI had a letter from him this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked back to his table, searched in the litter, and presently$
+amongst the papers pulled out a letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As a matter of fact, I had some business with him and I wrote to him$
+for information. The only thing he tells me is‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthis with a gesture of$
+despair‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\that Skyball and Polly Chaw‚M-^@M-^Tthose are the names of$
+race-horses, I presume‚M-^@M-^Twill win the two big handicaps next week and$
+that he has a flyer named Swift Kate that can beat anything‚M-^@M-^TI am$
+quoting his words‚M-^@M-^Ton legs over six furlongs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up over his glasses at Timothy, and on that young man‚M-^@M-^Ys face$
+was a seraphic smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds real nice to me,‚M-^@M-^] glowed Timothy.$
+$
+Remembering the injunctions of the servant, he was taking his adieu,$
+when his host asked, in a lower voice than that in which the$
+conversation had been carried on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you have not heard from your cousin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at him in astonishment. Had Sir John asked after the$
+Grand Llama of Tibet he would have been as well prepared to answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, no, sir‚M-^@M-^Tno‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tis he alive?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John Maxell looked at him sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alive? Of course. I thought you might have heard from him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\he disappeared. I only met him once when I was a$
+kid. Was he a friend‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tan acquaintance of yours?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John was drumming his fingers on the desk and his mind was far away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes and no,‚M-^@M-^] he said shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\I knew him, and at one time I was$
+friendly with him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly he glanced at his watch, and a look of consternation came to$
+his face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Great heavens!‚M-^@M-^] he cried. ‚M-^@M-^\I promised to meet my wife a quarter of an$
+hour ago. Good-bye! Good-bye!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He hand-shook Timothy from the room and the young man had to find his$
+way downstairs without guidance, because the manservant was at that$
+moment heavily engaged.$
+$
+From the floor below came a shrill, unpleasant sound, and Timothy$
+descended to find himself in the midst of a domestic crisis. There were$
+two ladies in the hall‚M-^@M-^Tone a mere silent, contained spectator, the$
+other the principal actress. He recognised her at once, but she did not$
+see him, because her attention was directed to the red-faced servant.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When I ring you on the ‚M-^@M-^Yphone, I expect to be answered,‚M-^@M-^] she was$
+saying. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to do except to sit round and keep your ears$
+open, you big, lazy devil!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But, my lady, I‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt answer me,‚M-^@M-^] she stormed. ‚M-^@M-^\If you think I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing better to do$
+than to sit at a ‚M-^@M-^Yphone waiting till you wake up, why, you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+mistaken‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys all. And if Sir John doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt fire you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about Sir John firing me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man with a sudden$
+change of manner. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve just had about as much of you as I can stand.$
+You keep your bossing for the movies, Lady Maxell. You‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to$
+try any of that stuff with me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was incapable of further speech, nor was there any necessity for it$
+since the man turned on his heels and disappeared into that mysterious$
+region which lies at the back of every entrance hall. Then for the first$
+time she saw Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you do, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She glared round at the interrupter, and for a moment he thought she$
+intended venting her anger on him. She was still frowning when he took$
+her limp hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre the Anderson boy, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked a little ungraciously.$
+$
+The old sense of antagonism was revived and intensified in him at the$
+touch of her hand. She was unchanged, looking, if anything, more pretty$
+than when he had seen her last, but the hardness at her mouth was$
+accentuated, and she had taken on an indefinable air of superiority$
+which differed very little from sheer insolence.$
+$
+A gold-rimmed lorgnette came up to survey him, and he was nettled‚M-^@M-^Tonly$
+women had the power to annoy him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt changed a bit,‚M-^@M-^] he bantered. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry your eyesight is$
+not so good as it was. Studio life is pretty tough on the eyes, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She closed her lorgnette with a snap, and turned to the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better see what Sir John is doing,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Ask him what he$
+thinks I am, that I should wait in the hall like a tramp.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was then that the girl came out of the shadow and Timothy saw her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is the ward or niece,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and sighed, for never$
+had he seen a human creature who so satisfied his eye. There is a beauty$
+which is neither statuesque nor cold, nor to be confounded with$
+prettiness. It is a beauty which depends upon no regularity of feature$
+or of colour, but which has its reason in its contradictions.$
+$
+The smiling Madonna whom Leonardo drew had such contradictory quality as$
+this girl possessed. For she was ninety per cent. child, and carried in$
+her face all the bubbling joy of youth. Yet she impressed Timothy as$
+being strange and unnatural. Her meekness, her ready obedience to carry$
+out the woman‚M-^@M-^Ys instruction, the very dignity of her departure‚M-^@M-^Tthese$
+things did not fit with the character he read in her face. Had she$
+turned curtly to this insolent woman and told her to carry her message$
+herself, or had she flown up the stairs calling for Sir John as she$
+went, these things would have been natural.$
+$
+Lady Maxell turned upon him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And see here, Mr. What‚M-^@M-^Ys-your-name, if you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of Sir John,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yll forget that I was ever in a studio. There are enough stories$
+about me in Bournemouth without your adding to the collection.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mother‚M-^@M-^Ys little thoroughbred!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy admiringly; ‚M-^@M-^\spoken like a$
+true little lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+In some respects he was wholly undisciplined, and had never learnt the$
+necessity of refraining from answering back. And the woman irritated$
+him, and irritation was a novel sensation.$
+$
+Her face was dark with rage, but it was upon Sir John, descending in$
+haste to meet his offended wife, that she turned the full batteries of$
+her anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know the time, of course. Your watch has stopped. It is hard$
+enough for me to keep my end up without you helping to make me look$
+foolish!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] protested Maxell in a flurry, ‚M-^@M-^\I assure you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can spend your time with this sort of trash,‚M-^@M-^] she indicated$
+Timothy, and Timothy bowed, ‚M-^@M-^\but you keep me waiting like a tailor‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+model at Sotheby‚M-^@M-^Ys, of all people in the world, when you know well$
+enough‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] pleaded the lawyer wearily, ‚M-^@M-^\my watch has certainly$
+stopped‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! You make me tired. What are you doing with this fellow? Do you$
+think I want reminding of movie days? Everybody knows this fellow‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+cheap gambler, who‚M-^@M-^Ys been fired out of every studio in England. You$
+allow your servants to insult me‚M-^@M-^Tand now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve brought this$
+prize-fighter to keep me in my place,‚M-^@M-^] and she pointed scornfully at the$
+amused Timothy.$
+$
+Half-way downstairs the girl stood watching the scene in silence, and it$
+was only when he became conscious of her presence that Timothy began to$
+feel a little uncomfortable.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, good-bye, Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry I intruded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\John, this man has insulted me! I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know$
+what he‚M-^@M-^Ys come for, but I suppose he wants something. He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of those$
+shifty fellows that hang around studios begging for money to bet with.$
+If you raise a hand to help him, why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I assure you,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John in his most pompous manner, ‚M-^@M-^\that this$
+young man has asked for nothing more than a letter of introduction. I$
+have a duty‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop!‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve a duty to me, too. Hold fast to your$
+money. Likely as not, you‚M-^@M-^Yll do neither with ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson$
+floating around.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was not her words, neither the contempt in her voice nor the insult$
+which stung him. The man who went twenty rounds with Kid Muldoon had$
+learnt to control his temper, but there was a new factor present‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+factor who wore a plain grey dress, and had two big, black eyes which$
+were now solemnly surveying him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is pretty difficult to give the lie to any$
+woman, but I tell you that what you say now is utterly false. I had no$
+intention when I came to Bournemouth of asking for anything that would$
+cost Sir John a penny. As to my past, I suppose it has been a little$
+eccentric, but it is clean, Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He meant no more than he said. He had no knowledge of Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+antecedents, or he might not have emphasised the purity of his own. But$
+the woman went back as though she had been whipped, and Timothy had a$
+momentary vision of a charging fury, before she flung herself upon him,$
+tearing at his face, shrieking aloud in her rage. . .$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He took off his hat and fanned himself. It was the first time he had$
+ever run away from trouble, but now he had almost flown. Those favoured$
+people who were in sight of Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys handsome villa, saw the$
+door swung open and a young man taking the front path in four strides$
+and the gate in another before he sped like the wind along the street.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy again.$
+$
+He went the longest way back to his hotel, to find that a telephone$
+message had been received from Sir John. It was short and to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt come again.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy read the slip and chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it likely?‚M-^@M-^] he asked the page who brought the message.$
+$
+Then he remembered the girl in grey, with the dark eyes, and he fingered$
+his smooth chin thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is worth while taking a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and$
+decided that, for the moment, it was not.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER X$
+$
+$
+LADY MAXELL yawned and put down the magazine she was reading. She$
+looked at her watch. It was ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. At such an hour Paris would be$
+beginning to wake up. The best people would still be in the midst of$
+their dinner, and Marie de Montdidier (born Hopkins) would be putting$
+the final dabs of powder on her nose in her dressing-room at the Folies$
+Berg√®res before making her first and her final appearance.$
+$
+The boulevards would be bright with light, and there would be lines of$
+twinkling autos in the Bois for the late diners at the Aromonville. She$
+looked across at the girl sitting under a big lamp in a window recess, a$
+book on her knees, but her mind and eyes elsewhere.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and the girl, with a start, woke from her reverie.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want me, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the matter with Sir John? You know him better than I do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know, Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt call me ‚M-^@M-^XLady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you to call me Sadie if you want to.‚M-^@M-^] There was a$
+silence. ‚M-^@M-^\Evidently you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want,‚M-^@M-^] snapped the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre what I$
+call a fine, sociable family. You seem to get your manners from your new$
+friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl went red.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My new friend?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Lady Maxell turned her back to her with$
+some resolution and resumed for a moment the reading of her magazine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt mind if you find any pleasure in talking to that kind of$
+insect,‚M-^@M-^] she said, putting the periodical down again. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, the world‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+full of those do-nothing boys. I suppose he knows there‚M-^@M-^Ys money coming$
+to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Very little, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little‚M-^@M-^Ys a lot to a man like that,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+think I am prejudiced because I was‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tannoyed the other day. That is$
+temperament.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the girl smiled, but it was a different kind of smile, and Lady$
+Maxell observed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can marry him as far as I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\These sneaking$
+meetings are not exactly complimentary to Sir John, that‚M-^@M-^Ys all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl closed her book, walked across to the shelf and put it away$
+before she spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yre speaking of Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I have met$
+him, but there has been nothing furtive in the meetings. He stopped me$
+in the park and apologised for having been responsible for the$
+scene‚M-^@M-^Tfor your temperament, you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked up sharply, but the girl met her eyes without$
+wavering.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt trying to be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] complained the older woman.$
+‚M-^@M-^\One never knows how deep you are. But I can tell you this, that sarcasm$
+is wasted on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sure of that,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked again, but apparently the girl was innocent of$
+offensive design.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say I met Mr. Anderson. He was very polite and very nice. Then I met$
+him again‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, I have met him several times,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\So far from his being a do-nothing, Lady Maxell, I think$
+you are doing him an injustice. He is working at the Parade Drug Store.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He will make a fine match for you,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will just$
+love having a shop-walker in the family!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+That ended the conversation for both of them, and they sat reading for a$
+quarter of an hour before Lady Maxell threw her magazine on the floor$
+and got up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John had a telegram yesterday that worried him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you$
+know what it was about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Honestly I do not know, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you ask$
+him yourself?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because he would tell me a lie,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman coolly, and the girl$
+winced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He brought all his money and securities from the Dawlish and County$
+Bank to-day and put them in his safe and he had the chief constable with$
+him for half an hour this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was news to the girl, and she was interested in spite of herself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to be frank with$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tfrankness pays sometimes. They called my marriage a romance of the$
+screen. Every newspaper said as much and I suppose that is true. But the$
+most romantic part of the marriage was my estate in Honolulu, my big$
+house in Paris and my bank balance. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys publicity man put all$
+that stuff about, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea that Sir John was highly disappointed$
+when he found he‚M-^@M-^Yd married me for myself alone. That‚M-^@M-^Ys how it strikes$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was a marriage which had shocked Society and had upset the smooth$
+current of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys life, placed in an entirely new light.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you very rich?‚M-^@M-^] she asked slowly, and Sadie laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rich! There was a tram fare between me and the workhouse the day I$
+married Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt blame him for being disappointed.$
+Lots of these cinema stars are worth millions‚M-^@M-^TI wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt one of them. I$
+married because I thought I was going to have a good time‚M-^@M-^Tlots of money$
+and plenty of travel‚M-^@M-^Tand I chose with my eyes shut.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was silent. For once Sadie Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys complaint had$
+justification. Sir John Maxell was not a spending man. He lived well,$
+but never outside the circle of necessity.$
+$
+The girl was about to speak, when there came a dramatic interruption.$
+$
+There was a ‚M-^@M-^\whang!‚M-^@M-^] a splintering of glass and something thudded$
+against the wall. Lady Maxell stood up as white as death.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was that?‚M-^@M-^] she gasped.$
+$
+The girl was pale, but she did not lose her nerve.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Somebody fired a shot. Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled aside the curtain. ‚M-^@M-^\The bullet went through the window.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Keep away from the window, you fool!‚M-^@M-^] screamed the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Turn out the$
+light! Ring the bell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mary moved across the room and turned the switch. They waited in$
+silence, but no other shot was fired. Perhaps it was an accident.$
+Somebody had been firing at a target. . . .$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go and tell my husband!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie. ‚M-^@M-^\Quickly!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl passed through the lighted hall upstairs and knocked at Sir$
+John‚M-^@M-^Ys door. There was no answer. She tried the door, but found it$
+locked. This was not unusual. He had a separate entrance to his study,$
+communicating by a balcony and a flight of stairs with the garden. A$
+wild fear seized her. Possibly Sir John had been in the garden when the$
+shot was fired; it may have been intended for him. She knocked again$
+louder, and this time she heard his step and the door was opened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you knock before?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\I was writing‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Then he saw her face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+The girl told him, and he made his way downstairs slowly, as was his$
+wont. He entered the drawing-room, switched on the lights, and without a$
+glance at his wife walked to the window and examined the shattered pane.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I imagined I heard a noise, but thought somebody had dropped something.$
+When did this happen? Just before you came up?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+Maxell looked from one to the other. His wife was almost speechless with$
+terror, and Mary Maxell alone was calm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has come already,‚M-^@M-^] he said musingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I did not think that this$
+would happen so soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked down to the hall where the telephone hung and rang through to$
+the police station, and the girl heard all he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is Sir John Maxell speaking. A shot has just been fired through$
+my window. No, not at me‚M-^@M-^TI was in my study. Apparently a rifle shot.$
+Yes, I was right‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Presently he came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The police will be here in a few moments to make a search of the$
+grounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I doubt whether they will catch the miscreant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it possible that it was an accident?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Accident?‚M-^@M-^] He smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly. ‚M-^@M-^\That kind of$
+accident is liable to happen again. You had better come up to my study,$
+both of you, till the police arrive,‚M-^@M-^] he said and led the way up the$
+stairs.$
+$
+He did not attempt to support his wife, though her nerve was obviously$
+shaken. Possibly he did not observe this fact until they were in the$
+room, for after a glance at her face he pushed a chair forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+The study was the one room to which his wife was seldom admitted.$
+Dominated as he was by her in other matters, he was firm on this point.$
+It was perhaps something of a novelty for her‚M-^@M-^Ta novelty which will$
+still the whimper of the crying child has something of the same effect$
+upon a nervous woman.$
+$
+The door of the safe was open and the big table was piled high with$
+sealed packages. The only money she saw was a thick pad of bank-notes$
+fastened about with a paper bandage, on which something was written. On$
+this she fixed her eyes. She had never seen so much money in her life,$
+and he must have noticed the attention this display of wealth had$
+created, for he took up the money and slipped it into a large envelope.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is your money, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he beamed over his glasses at the girl.$
+$
+She was feeling the reaction of her experience now and was trembling in$
+every limb. Yet she thought she recognised in this diversion an attempt$
+on his part to soothe her, and she smiled and tried hard to respond.$
+$
+They had been daily companions since she was a mite of four, and between$
+him and his dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child there was a whole lot of understanding$
+and sympathy which other people never knew.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My money, uncle?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I realised your investments last week,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I happened to know$
+that the Corporation in which the money stood had incurred very heavy$
+losses through some error in insurance. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a great deal, but I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt afford to let you take any further risks.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was, of course, a possibility of this shot having been fired by$
+accident,‚M-^@M-^] he went on, reverting to the matter which would naturally be$
+at the back of his mind. Then he fell into thought, pacing the room in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, stopping suddenly in front of the$
+girl. ‚M-^@M-^\You told me you were going to a concert.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before she could explain why she changed her mind they heard the sound$
+of voices in the hall.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stay here,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John. ‚M-^@M-^\It is the police. I will go down and tell$
+them all there is to know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When her husband had gone, Lady Maxell rose from her chair. The table,$
+with its sealed packages, drew her like a magnet. She fingered them one$
+by one, and came at last to the envelope containing Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys patrimony.$
+This she lifted in her hands, weighing it. Then, with a deep sigh, she$
+replaced the package on the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money there,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and Mary smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a great deal, I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid. Father was comparatively poor when he$
+died.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell thoughtfully; ‚M-^@M-^\more than I have ever$
+seen since I have been in this house, believe me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She returned, as though fascinated, and lifted the envelope again and$
+peered inside.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor, was he?‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you people don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what poverty$
+is. Do you know what all this means?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held the envelope up and there was a look in her face which the girl$
+had never seen before.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means comfort, it means freedom from worry, it means that you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have to pretend and make love to men whom you loathe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had risen and was staring at her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell!‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Why‚M-^@M-^Twhy‚M-^@M-^TI never think of$
+money like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why should you?‚M-^@M-^] said the woman roughly, as she flung the package on$
+the table. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been after money in quantities like that all my life.$
+It has always been dangling in front of me and eluding me‚M-^@M-^Teluding is$
+the word, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are all those pictures?‚M-^@M-^] she changed the subject abruptly,$
+pointing to the framed photographs which covered the walls. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+photographs of India, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John was born in Morocco and lived there$
+until he went to school. He speaks Arabic like a native. Did you know$
+that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys strange. Morocco!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know it?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been there‚M-^@M-^Tonce,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\Did Sir John go$
+often?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before he married, yes,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary. ‚M-^@M-^\He had large interests there at$
+one time, I think.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John came back at that moment, and Mary noticed that his first$
+glance was at the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, they‚M-^@M-^Yve found nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\neither footprints nor the$
+empty shell. They‚M-^@M-^Yre making a search of the grounds to-morrow. Lebbitter$
+wanted to post a man to protect the house in view of the other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What other matter?‚M-^@M-^] asked his wife quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\nothing really which concerns you. Of course,$
+I would not allow the police to do that. It would make the house more$
+conspicuous than it is at present.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at the two.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now,‚M-^@M-^] he said bluntly, ‚M-^@M-^\I think you had better go off to bed. I have$
+still a lot of work to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His wife obeyed without a word, and the girl was following her, when he$
+called her back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+the best man that ever lived, but I‚M-^@M-^Yve tried to make you happy, my dear,$
+in my own way. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been as a daughter to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked up at him with shining eyes. She could not trust herself to$
+speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Things haven‚M-^@M-^Yt gone as well as they might during the past year,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I made a colossal blunder, but I made it with my eyes open. It$
+hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt been pleasant for either of us, but there‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+regretting what you cannot mend. Mary, they tell me that you‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+seeing a lot of this young man Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was annoyed to find herself going red when there was really no$
+reason for it. She need not ask who ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^] were, she could guess.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been making inquiries about that boy,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+I can tell you this, he is straight. Perhaps he has led an$
+unconventional life, but all that he told Sadie was true. He‚M-^@M-^Ys clean,$
+and, Mary, that counts for something in this world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He seemed at a loss how to proceed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anything might happen,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Although I‚M-^@M-^Ym not an old man, I$
+have enemies. . . .‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have many enemies,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Some of them are hateful, and I want to$
+tell you this, that if trouble ever comes and that boy is within$
+call‚M-^@M-^Tgo to him. I know men, good, bad and indifferent; he‚M-^@M-^Ys neither bad$
+nor indifferent. And now, good night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He kissed her on the forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You needn‚M-^@M-^Yt tell your aunt what I‚M-^@M-^Yve been talking about,‚M-^@M-^] he said at$
+parting and led her to the door, closing and locking it behind her.$
+$
+He sat down in his chair for a very long time before he made a move,$
+then he began picking up the packages and carrying them to the safe. He$
+stopped half-way through and resumed his seat in the chair, waiting for$
+the hour to pass, by which time he judged the household would be asleep.$
+$
+At midnight he took a pair of rubber boots from a locker, pulled them$
+on, and went out through the door leading to the balcony, down the$
+covered stairway to the garden. Unerringly he walked across the lawn to$
+a corner of his grounds which his gardeners had never attempted to$
+cultivate. He stopped once and groped about in the bushes for a spade$
+which he had carefully planted there a few nights before. His hand$
+touched the rotting wood of an older spade and he smiled. For six years$
+the tool had remained where he had put it the last time he had visited$
+this No-Man‚M-^@M-^Ys-Land.$
+$
+Presently he came to a little hillock and began digging. The soil was$
+soft, and he had not gone far before the spade struck wood. He cleared a$
+space two feet square and drew from the earth a small crescent of wood.$
+It was, in fact, a part of the wooden cover of a well which had long$
+since gone dry but which had been covered up by its previous owner and$
+again covered by Maxell.$
+$
+Lying at full length on the ground, he reached down through the$
+aperture, and his fingers found a big rusty nail on which was suspended$
+a length of piano wire. At the end of the wire was attached a small$
+leather bag and this he drew up and unfastened, and putting the bag on$
+one side, let the free end of the wire fall into the well.$
+$
+He replaced the wood, covered it again with earth, all the time$
+exercising care, for, small as the aperture was, it was big enough for$
+even a man of his size to slip through.$
+$
+A cloaked figure which stood in the shadow of the bushes watching him,$
+which had followed him as noiselessly across the lawn, saw him lift the$
+bag and take it back to the house and disappear through the covered$
+stairway. So still a night it was, that the watcher could hear the click$
+of the lower door as Sir John locked it, and the soft pad of his feet as$
+they mounted the stairs.$

+$
+$
+MR. GOLDBERG, the manager and proprietor of the Parade Drug Store, was$
+a man who possessed neither a sense of imagination nor the spirit of$
+romance. He sent peremptorily for Timothy, and Timothy came with a$
+feeling that all was not well.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said Goldberg in his best magisterial manner, ‚M-^@M-^\I took$
+you into my shop because I was short of a man and because I understood$
+that you had had some business experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business experience,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy carefully, ‚M-^@M-^\of a kind.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I gave you particular instructions,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\on$
+one very vital point. We carry a full line of all the best proprietorial$
+medicines, and our customers can always get them upon application. Each$
+of those medicines we duplicate, as you know, providing the same$
+constituents and charging some sixpence to a shilling less‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, we$
+are out to save the public from being robbed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understand you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I don‚M-^@M-^Yt see much difference$
+between robbing the public and robbing the patent medicine proprietors,$
+and all that just-as-good stuff never did impress me, anyway. It stands$
+to reason,‚M-^@M-^] he said, leaning over the desk and speaking with the$
+earnestness of a crusader, ‚M-^@M-^\that the advertised article must be more$
+even in quality and it must be good all round. You can‚M-^@M-^Yt advertise a bad$
+article and get away with it, except on the first sale, and that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+pay the advertiser. The goods sell the goods, and the advertisement is$
+only to make you take the first lick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I do not want a lecture on advertising or on commercial morality,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Mr. Goldberg with ominous calm. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely want to tell you that you were$
+overheard by my chief assistant telling a customer not to ‚M-^@M-^Xtake a$
+chance‚M-^@M-^Y on one of my own pills.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys right,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, nodding his head vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Guilty, my$
+lord. What about it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have had a further complaint,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg, consulting with$
+elaborate ceremony a little notebook. ‚M-^@M-^\I understand that you have$
+initiated the awful practice of offering to toss customers for their$
+change. People have written me strong letters of complaint about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because they lost,‚M-^@M-^] said the indignant Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\what‚M-^@M-^Ys wrong about$
+that, anyway, Mr. Goldberg? I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pocket the money, and I win twice$
+out of every three times. If a fellow likes to take a chance as to$
+whether he gets sixpence or we get a shilling, why worry?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The outraged Mr. Goldberg brindled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sort of thing may be all right at a country fair or even in a$
+country shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not good enough for the Parade Drug$
+Store, Bournemouth, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll dispense with your services as from this$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre losing a good man,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, but Mr. Goldberg did$
+not seem to take that loss to heart.$
+$
+All ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] jobs ended violently. He never conceived$
+of them ending in any other way, and invariably regarded the sum of$
+money which was received in lieu of notice, or as compensation for$
+breach of contract, as being something in the nature of a nest-egg which$
+a kindly Providence had foreordained, and he was neither cast down nor$
+elated by the crisis in his affairs when, by a fortunate accident, he$
+met Mary Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tthe fortune was apparent, but the accident belonged to$
+the category which determined the hour at which trains leave stations.$
+$
+Hitherto, on the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys part, these meetings had been fraught with a$
+certain amount of apprehension, if not terror. They had begun when$
+Timothy had stopped her on the morning after his quarrel with Lady$
+Maxell, and had made bland inquiries as to that lady‚M-^@M-^Ys condition. Then$
+she had been in a panic and frantically anxious to end the interview,$
+and it required all her self-restraint to prevent her flying at top$
+speed from this wicked young man who had been so abominably rude.$
+$
+At their second meeting he had greeted her as an old friend, and she had$
+left him with the illusion of a life-time acquaintance. Hereafter$
+matters went smoothly, and they went so because Timothy Anderson was$
+unlike any of the other boys she had ever met.$
+$
+He paid her no compliments, he did not grow sentimental, he neither$
+tried to hold her hand nor kiss her, nor was he ever oppressed by that$
+overwhelming melancholy which is the heritage and pride of youth.$
+$
+Not once did he hint at an early decline or the possibility of his going$
+away to die in far lands. Instead he kept her in screams of laughter at$
+his interpretation of movie plays in the making. He did not ask for a$
+keepsake; the only request he made of her in this direction was one$
+which first took her breath away. Thereafter she never met him unless$
+she had in the bag which slung from her wrist one small box of matches;$
+for ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson had never possessed or carried the means of$
+ignition for his cigarette for one whole hour together.$
+$
+Timothy told her most of what the proprietor of the Parade Drug Store$
+had told him. The girl thought it was a joke, because that was exactly$
+the way Timothy presented the matter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you won‚M-^@M-^Yt be going away soon?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not till I go abroad,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy calmly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going abroad too?‚M-^@M-^] she asked in surprise.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to Paris and Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^Tespecially to Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\and afterwards I may run across to Algeria or to Egypt.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him with a new respect. She was less impressed by the$
+great possessions which his plans betrayed than by his confident$
+independence, and dimly she wondered why he was working at a drug-store$
+for low wages and wondered, too, whether he was‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you blushing about?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt blushing,‚M-^@M-^] she protested; ‚M-^@M-^\I was just wondering whether I$
+could ever afford a trip like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you can,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\If I can afford it,$
+you can, can‚M-^@M-^Yt you? If I go abroad and stay at the best hotels, and go$
+joy rides in the Alps and plan all this when I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got fifteen$
+shillings over my rent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt fifteen shillings over your rent!‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, aghast.$
+‚M-^@M-^\But how can you go abroad without money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was genuinely astounded that she could ask so absurd a question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\A little thing like money$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt really count.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre very silly,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, there was something I wanted$
+to tell you, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may call me Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to call you Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she replied.$
+$
+He shook his head with a pained expression.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Yll be ever so much more sociable if you call me Timothy and I call$
+you Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We can be very sociable without that familiarity,‚M-^@M-^] she said severely.$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was just going to tell you something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They sat on the grass together, on the shadow fringe of a big oak and$
+the spring sunshine wove its restless arabesques on her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\that last night I had two queer$
+experiences and I was scared; oh, scared to death!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eating things at night,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy oracularly, ‚M-^@M-^\especially before$
+you go to bed‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt dreaming,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly, ‚M-^@M-^\nor was it a nightmare. I$
+won‚M-^@M-^Yt tell you if you‚M-^@M-^Yre so horrid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym only speaking as an ex-chemist and druggist,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gravely;$
+‚M-^@M-^\but please forgive me. Tell me what it is, Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Mary Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he compromised.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\First I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the least worst,‚M-^@M-^] she began. ‚M-^@M-^\It happened about one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the morning. I had gone to bed awfully tired, but somehow I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt sleep, so I got up and walked about the room. I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt like$
+putting on the light because that meant drawing down the blinds which I$
+had let up when I went to bed, and the blinds make such a noise that I$
+thought the whole of the house would hear. So I put on my dressing-gown$
+and sat by the window. It was rather chilly, but my wrap was warm, and$
+sitting there I dozed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know how long, but it was nearly an hour,$
+I think. When I woke up I saw a man right in the centre of the lawn.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What sort of a man?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is the peculiar thing about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt a white$
+man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A coon?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I think it must have been a Moor. He wore a long white dress that$
+reached down to his ankles, and over that he had a big, heavy black$
+cloak.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He went round the corner of the house towards uncle‚M-^@M-^Ys private stairway$
+and he was gone quite a long time. My first thought was to awaken uncle$
+and tell him, but then I remembered that Sir John had spent a long time$
+in Morocco and possibly he knew that the man was about the house. You$
+see, we have had Moorish visitors before, when ships have come to Poole.$
+Once we had a very important man, a Kaid, and Sir John made queer tea$
+for him in glasses with mint and stuff. So I just didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what to$
+do. Whilst I was wondering whether I ought not at least to wake Lady$
+Maxell, he reappeared, walked across the lawn and went down the path$
+which leads to the back entrance‚M-^@M-^Tyou‚M-^@M-^Yre laughing at me,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you mistake for a laugh,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\is merely one$
+large smile of pleasure at being in your confidence.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was in two minds as to whether she would be angry or pleased, but$
+his tone changed to a more serious one.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like the idea of the gaudy East wandering loose under your$
+bedroom window in the middle of the night,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell Lady$
+Maxell this morning?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, she was up very early and has been out all day. I have not seen$
+her‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, she was not at breakfast. Now I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the really$
+serious thing that happened, and I do hope, Mr. Anderson, that you won‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+be flippant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Trust me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl had no reason to complain of his attitude when she had$
+described the shooting incident. He was aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is terrible!‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, it might have hit you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it might have hit me,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+whole point of my story, so far as you are concerned‚M-^@M-^TI mean, so far as$
+I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she added hastily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So fax as I am concerned too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\I just hate the$
+idea of anything even frightening you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She rose hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am going to shop now,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the hurry?‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ignoring his question, ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you to$
+think that uncle is feeling badly about you because of what has happened$
+in the house. He spoke to me of you last night, and he spoke very$
+nicely. I am worried to death about Sir John. He has made enemies in his$
+life, and I am sure that this shooting affair is the sequel to some old$
+feud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should say that is so,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He looked down at the grass very thoughtfully and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll go home,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I had better sleep this afternoon if I$
+am to be up all night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Up all night?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\What is happening? Is there a$
+ball or something?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will be something livelier than a ball,‚M-^@M-^] he said grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if I$
+find anybody in your garden to-night. And Miss Maxell, if you look out$
+of your window and you see a solitary figure on sentry-go don‚M-^@M-^Yt shoot,$
+because it will be me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] she gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt do it, Mr. Anderson. Uncle$
+would be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped her with a gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Possibly nobody will come to-night,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and as likely as not I$
+shall be pinched by the police as a suspicious character. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+chance that somebody will come, and that‚M-^@M-^Ys the chance I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to$
+take.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XII$
+$
+$
+TRUE to his word, he returned to his lodgings and spent the afternoon$
+in slumber. He had the gift which all great men possess, of being able$
+to sleep at will. He was staying at a boarding-house, and occupied a$
+room which had originally been a side veranda, but had been walled in$
+and converted into an extra bedroom. It was a remarkably convenient room$
+for him, as he had discovered on previous occasions. He had but to open$
+the window and drop on to the grass to make his exit without anybody in$
+the house being the wiser. More to the point, he could return at any$
+hour by the same route without disturbing the household.$
+$
+He had his supper, and whilst it was still very light he went out to$
+reconnoitre Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys demesne. He was able to make the circuit of the$
+house, which occupied a corner site and was isolated by two lanes, and$
+he saw nobody until, returning to the front of the house, a car drove up$
+and a woman alighted.$
+$
+He had no difficulty in recognising Lady Maxell, but the taxi interested$
+him more than the lady. It was smothered with mud and had evidently come$
+a long journey.$
+$
+As evidently she had hired it in some distant town and she had not as$
+yet finished with it, because she gave the man some directions and$
+money, and from the profound respect which the chauffeur showed, it was$
+clear that that money was merely a tip.$
+$
+Timothy stood where he could clearly be seen, but her back was toward$
+him all the time and she did not so much as glance in his direction when$
+she passed through the gate and up the garden path.$
+$
+It was curious, thought Timothy, that she did not take the car up the$
+drive to the house. More curious was it that she should, at this late$
+hour of the evening, have further use for it.$
+$
+He returned to his room, full of theories, the majority of which were$
+wholly wild and improbable. He lay on his bed, indulging in those dreams$
+which made up the happiest part of his life. Of late he had taken a new$
+and a more radiant pattern to the web of his fancy and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, fiddlesticks!‚M-^@M-^] he said in disgust, rolling over and sitting up with$
+a yawn.$
+$
+He heard the feet of the boarders on the gravel path outside, and once$
+he heard a girl say evidently to a visitor:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you see that funny room! That is Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was still an hour or so to be passed, and he joined the party in$
+the parlour so restless and distrait as to attract attention and a$
+little mild raillery from his fellow guests. He went back to his room,$
+turned on the light and pulled a trunk from under the bed.$
+$
+Somehow his mind had been running all day upon that erring cousin whose$
+name he bore and whose disappearance from public life was such a$
+mystery. Possibly it was Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys words which had brought Alfred$
+Cartwright to his mind. His mother had left him a number of family$
+documents, which, with the indolence of youth, he had never examined$
+very closely. He had the impression that they consisted in the main of$
+receipts, old diplomas of his father‚M-^@M-^Ys (who was an engineer) and sundry$
+other family documents which were not calculated to excite the curiosity$
+of the adventurous youth.$
+$
+He took out the two big envelopes in which these papers were kept and$
+turned them on to the bed, examining them one by one. Why his cousin$
+should be in his mind, why he should have taken this action at that$
+particular moment, the psychologist and the psychical expert alone can$
+explain. They may produce in explanation such esoteric phenomena as$
+auras, influences, and telepathies, and perhaps they are right.$
+$
+He had not searched long before he came upon a small package of$
+newspaper cuttings, bound about by a rubber band. He read them at first$
+without interest, and then without comprehension. There was one cutting,$
+however, which had been clipped from its context, which seemed to tell$
+the whole story of the rest. It ran:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\When Cartwright stood up for sentence he did not seem to be$
+    greatly troubled by his serious position. As the words ‚M-^@M-^Xtwenty$
+    years‚M-^@M-^Y passed Mr. Justice Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips, he fell back as if he$
+    had been shot. Then, springing to the edge of the dock, he$
+    hurled an epithet at his lordship. Some of his business$
+    associates suggest that the learned judge was a partner of$
+    Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^Tan astonishing and most improper suggestion to$
+    make. In view of the statement that the prisoner made before the$
+    trial, when suggestions had been made in a newspaper that the$
+    judge had been connected with him in business years before, and$
+    remembering that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys statement was to the effect that$
+    he had had no business transactions with the judge, it seems as$
+    though the outburst was made in a fit of spleen at the severity$
+    of the sentence. Sir John Maxell, after the case, took the$
+    unusual step of informing a Press representative that he$
+    intended placing his affairs in the hands of a committee for$
+    investigation, and had invited the Attorney-General to appoint$
+    that committee. ‚M-^@M-^XI insist upon this being done,‚M-^@M-^Y he said,$
+    ‚M-^@M-^Xbecause after the prisoner‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation I should not feel$
+    comfortable until an impartial committee had examined my$
+    affairs.‚M-^@M-^Y It is understood that after the investigation the$
+    learned judge intends retiring from the Bench.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy gasped. So that was the explanation. That was why Maxell had$
+written to him, that was why he made no reference at all to his father,$
+but to this disreputable cousin of his. Slowly he returned the package$
+to its envelope, dropped it into his trunk and pushed the trunk under$
+the bed.$
+$
+And that was the secret of Cousin Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys disappearance. He might$
+have guessed it; he might even have known had he troubled to look at$
+these papers.$
+$
+He sat on the bed, his hands clasping his knees. It was not a pleasant$
+reflection that he had a relative, and a relative moreover after whom he$
+was named, serving what might be a life sentence in a convict$
+establishment. But what made him think of the matter to-night?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson! Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round with a start. The man whose face was framed in the$
+open window might have been forty, fifty or sixty. It was a face heavily$
+seamed and sparsely bearded‚M-^@M-^Ta hollow-eyed, hungry face, but those eyes$
+burnt like fire. Timothy jumped up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Who are you ‚M-^@M-^XTimothying‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] the man laughed unpleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Can I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, you can come in,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He wondered what old acquaintance this was who had come to the tramp$
+level, and rapidly turned over in his mind all the possible candidates$
+for trampdom he had met.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the man again. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yve tracked you$
+here, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve been sitting in those bushes for two hours. I heard one$
+of the boarders say that it was your window and I waited till it was$
+dark before I came out.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All this is highly interesting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, surveying the shrunken$
+figure without enthusiasm, ‚M-^@M-^\but who are you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had a provisional pardon,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and they put me in a$
+sanatorium‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Yve something the matter with one of my lungs. It was$
+always a trouble to me. I was supposed to stay in the sanatorium‚M-^@M-^Tthat$
+was one of the terms on which I was pardoned‚M-^@M-^Tbut I escaped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy stared at him with open mouth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alfred Cartwright!‚M-^@M-^] he breathed.$
+$
+The man nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys me,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Timothy looked down at the edge of the black box.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that is why I was thinking about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, this beats$
+all! Sit down, won‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pulled a chair up for his visitor and again gazed on him with$
+curiosity but without affection. Something in Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys attitude annoyed$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not glad to see me?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not very,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\The truth is, you‚M-^@M-^Yve only just come into$
+existence so far as I am concerned. I thought you were dead.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not until a few minutes ago. I was reading the cuttings about your$
+trial‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that was what you were reading?‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to see ‚M-^@M-^Yem$
+one of these days. Do you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve come for?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was only at that moment that Sir John flashed through Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys mind.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I guess what you‚M-^@M-^Yve come after,‚M-^@M-^] he said slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre here to see$
+Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym here to see Mister Justice Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man between his teeth.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took the stump of a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lit it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\John Maxell and I have a score to settle, and it is going to be settled$
+very soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tide and weather permitting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy flippantly, recovering his$
+self-possession. ‚M-^@M-^\All that vendetta stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt go, Mr. Cartwright.‚M-^@M-^]$
+Then he asked in a flash: ‚M-^@M-^\Did you shoot at him last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise was a convincing reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shoot at him? I only got to this place this afternoon. It‚M-^@M-^Ys more likely$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys waiting to shoot at me, for the sanatorium people will have$
+telegraphed to him the moment I was missing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy walked to the window and pulled down the blinds.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now tell me, Mr. Cartwright, before we go any farther, do you still$
+persist in the story you told the court, that the judge was a party to$
+your swindle?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A party to it!‚M-^@M-^] said the other man furiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course he was! I was$
+using the money of my companies to buy concessions from the Moorish$
+Government, as much on his behalf as on mine. He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt in the Brigot$
+swindle‚M-^@M-^Tbut he held shares in the company I was financing. We located a$
+gold mine in the Angera country, and Maxell and I went across to Europe$
+every year regularly to look after our property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We had to keep it quiet because we secured the concessions from the$
+Pretender, knowing that he‚M-^@M-^Yd put the Sultan out of business the moment$
+he got busy. If it had been known, the Sultan would have repudiated the$
+concession, and our Government would have upheld the repudiation. Maxell$
+speaks the language like a native, and I learnt enough to get on with El$
+Mograb, who is the biggest thing amongst the rebel tribes. El Mograb$
+wanted us to stay there, Maxell and I; he‚M-^@M-^Yd have made us shereefs or$
+pashas, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd have done it, because I knew there was going to be an$
+investigation sooner or later into the affairs of my companies. But$
+Maxell wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have it. He always pretended that, so far as he knew, my$
+financing was straight. You know the rest,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\When I came before$
+Maxell, I thought I was safe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John allowed his affairs to be inspected,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\If he$
+had been engaged with you in this Morocco business, there must have been$
+papers to prove it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed harshly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course he‚M-^@M-^Yd allow his affairs to be investigated,‚M-^@M-^] he sneered. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you think that old fox couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt _cache_ all the documents that put him$
+wrong? Papers? Why, he must have enough papers to hang him, if you could$
+only find ‚M-^@M-^Yem!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+There was one thing he was determined that this man should _not_ do, and$
+that was to disturb the peace of mind, not of Sir John Maxell or his$
+wife, but of a certain goddess whose bedroom overlooked the lawn.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What am I going to do?‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going up to get$
+my share. And he‚M-^@M-^Yll be lucky if that‚M-^@M-^Ys all he loses. One of the mines$
+was sold to a syndicate last year‚M-^@M-^TI had news of it in gaol. He didn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+get much for it because he was in a hurry to sell‚M-^@M-^TI suppose his other$
+investments must have been going wrong twelve months ago‚M-^@M-^Tbut I want my$
+share of that!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you had best see Sir John in the morning. I will arrange an$
+interview.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the morning!‚M-^@M-^] said the other contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose you make the$
+arrangement, what would happen? When I went up there I should find a$
+couple of cops waiting to pinch me. I know John! I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and the man stared at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You think not?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\What has it to do with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite a lot,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely state that you will not see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright stroked his bristly chin undecidedly and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, well,‚M-^@M-^] he said in a milder tone, ‚M-^@M-^\maybe you can fix things up for$
+me in the morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you sleeping to-night?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had money, a little; and he had arranged to sleep at the house of a$
+man he had known in better times. Timothy accompanied him through the$
+window and into the street, and walked with him to the end of the road.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If my gamble had come off, you‚M-^@M-^Yd have benefited, Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+man unexpectedly, breaking in upon another topic which they were$
+discussing.$
+$
+They parted, and Timothy watched him out of sight, then turned on and$
+walked in the opposite direction, to take up his self-imposed vigil.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIII$
+$
+$
+THERE was something in the air that was electrical, and Mary Maxell$
+felt it as she sat at supper with Sir John and his wife. Maxell was$
+unusually silent and his wife amazingly so. She was nervous and almost$
+jumped when a remark was addressed to her. The old truculence which$
+distinguished her every word and action, her readiness to take offence,$
+to see a slight in the most innocent remark, and her combativeness$
+generally, had disappeared; she was almost meek when she replied to her$
+husband‚M-^@M-^Ys questions.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just went round shopping and then decided to call on a girl I had$
+known a long time ago. She lives in the country, and I felt so nervous$
+and depressed this morning that I thought a ride in a taxi would do me$
+good.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you take our car?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt decide until the last moment to go out to her, and then I went$
+by train one way.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad you went into the fresh air,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it will do you good.$
+The country is not so beautiful as Honolulu, but it is not without its$
+attractions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was unusual for the Judge to be sarcastic, but it was less usual for$
+Lady Maxell to accept sarcasm without a retort. To Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise she$
+made no reply, though a faint smile curved those straight lips of hers$
+for a second.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it was a burglar last night?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good heavens, no!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\Burglars do not shoot up the house$
+they burgle.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it is safe to have all this money in the house?‚M-^@M-^] she$
+asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly safe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that need alarm you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+No further reference was made to the matter, and presently Sir John went$
+up to his study. Mrs. Maxell did not go to the parlour, but drew a chair$
+to the fire in the dining-room and read, and the girl followed her$
+example. Presently the elder woman left the room and was gone a quarter$
+of an hour before she returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, so sweetly that the girl was startled, ‚M-^@M-^\such an$
+annoying thing has happened‚M-^@M-^TI have lost the key of my wardrobe. You$
+borrowed one of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicates the other day‚M-^@M-^Twhere did you put$
+the ring?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+John Maxell was a methodical and systematic man. He had a duplicate set$
+of all the keys in the house, and these as a rule were kept in a small$
+wall-safe in his own bedroom. He had never invited his wife to use that$
+receptacle, but she had a shrewd idea that the combination which was$
+denied to her had been given to the girl.$
+$
+Mary hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think if you asked Uncle‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the lady, ‚M-^@M-^\if I went to him now, he‚M-^@M-^Yd never forgive$
+me. If you know where the keys are, be an angel and get them for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl rose, and Lady Maxell followed her upstairs. Her own room was$
+next to her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys and communicated, but the door was invariably$
+locked on Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys side. Presently the girl came in to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here they are,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Please let me put them back quickly. I feel$
+very guilty at having taken them at all without his permission.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And for goodness‚M-^@M-^Y sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt tell him,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, examining the$
+keys.$
+$
+At last she found the one she wanted, but was a long time in the$
+process. She opened her bureau and the girl took the big key-ring from$
+her hand with such evident relief that Lady Maxell laughed.$
+$
+It had been easier than she thought and unless she made a blunder, the$
+key she had selected from the bunch while she was fumbling at the$
+bureau, would make just the difference‚M-^@M-^Tjust the difference.$
+$
+It was not customary for Sir John to come down from his study to enjoy$
+the ladies‚M-^@M-^Y company after dinner, but on this evening he made an$
+exception to his rule. He found his wife and ward reading, one on each$
+side of the fireplace. Lady Maxell looked up when her husband came in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a curious story, John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think it must be an$
+American story, about a woman who robbed her husband and the police$
+refused to arrest her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing curious about that,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\in law a wife$
+cannot rob her husband or a husband his wife.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that if you came to my Honolulu estate and stole my pearls,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said banteringly, ‚M-^@M-^\I could not have you arrested.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except for walking in my sleep!‚M-^@M-^] he said smilingly, and they both$
+laughed together.$
+$
+He had never seen her so amiable, and for the first time that day‚M-^@M-^Tit$
+had been a very trying and momentous day‚M-^@M-^The had his misgivings. She,$
+with the memory of her good day‚M-^@M-^Ys work, the excellent terms she had$
+arranged with the skipper of the _Lord Lawrence_, due to leave$
+Southampton for Cadiz at daylight the next morning, had no misgivings at$
+all, especially when she thought of a key she had placed under her$
+pillow. She had had the choice of two boats, the _Lord Lawrence_ and the$
+_Saffi_, but the _Saffi‚M-^@M-^Ys_ voyage would have been a long one, and its$
+port of destination might hold discomfort which she had no wish to$
+experience.$
+$
+The household retired at eleven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock, and it was past midnight before$
+Sadie Maxell heard her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys door close, and half an hour later$
+before the click of the switch told her that his light had been$
+extinguished.$
+$
+He was a ready sleeper, but she gave him yet another half-hour before$
+she opened the door of her bedroom and stepped out into the black$
+corridor. She moved noiselessly towards the study, her only fear being$
+that the baronet had locked the door before he came out. But this fear$
+was not well founded, and the door yielded readily to her touch. She was$
+dressed, and carried only a small attach√© case filled with the bare$
+necessities for the voyage.$
+$
+She pushed the catch of her electric lamp, located the safe and opened$
+it with no difficulty. She found herself surprisingly short of breath,$
+and her heart beat at such a furious rate that she thought it must be$
+audible to everybody in the house. The envelope with the money lay at$
+the bottom of the others, and she transferred its contents to her$
+attach√© case in a few seconds.$
+$
+Then her heart stood still. . . .$
+$
+It was only the faintest creak she heard, but it came from a corner of$
+the room where the door leading to the cupboard stairway was placed. She$
+saw a faint grey line of light appear‚M-^@M-^Tthe stairway had a glass roof and$
+admitted enough light to show her that the door was slowly opening. She$
+had to bite her lips to stop herself from screaming. To make her escape$
+or to rouse Sir John was impossible, and she opened the attach√© case$
+again, and with trembling fingers felt for the little revolver which she$
+had taken from her drawer. She felt safer now, yet she had not the$
+courage to switch on the light.$
+$
+She saw the figure of a man silhouetted in the opening, then the door$
+closed, and her terror bred of itself a certain courage.$
+$
+She flashed the light full on his face. The dead silence was broken when$
+she whispered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, God! Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who‚M-^@M-^Ys that?‚M-^@M-^] he whispered, and snatched the torch from her hand.$
+$
+He looked at her long and curiously, and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I expected to find that Maxell had taken most of my possessions,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I never thought he would take my wife!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us see what all this is about,‚M-^@M-^] boomed the big voice of John Maxell$
+almost in the man‚M-^@M-^Ys ear, he was so close, and suddenly the room was$
+flooded with light.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIV$
+$
+$
+THE self-appointed watcher found time pass very slowly. Twelve and one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock struck from a distant church, but there was no sign of midnight$
+assassins, and the house, looking very solemn and quiet in the light of$
+a waning moon, irritated and annoyed him. From the roadway where he$
+paced silently to and fro‚M-^@M-^The had taken the precaution of wearing a pair$
+of rubber-soled shoes‚M-^@M-^The could glimpse Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys window, and once he$
+thought he saw her looking out.$
+$
+He made a point of walking entirely round the house twice in every hour,$
+and it was on one of these excursions that he heard a sound which$
+brought him to a standstill. It was a sound like two pieces of flat$
+board being smacked together sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tap . . . tap!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and listened, but heard nothing further. Then he retraced his$
+footsteps to the front of the house and waited, but there was no sound$
+or sign. Another half-hour passed, and then a patrolling policeman came$
+along on the other side of the roadway. At the sight of the young man he$
+crossed the road, and Jim recognised an acquaintance of his drug-store$
+days. Nothing was to be gained by being evasive or mysterious, and$
+Timothy told the policeman frankly his object.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I heard about the shooting last night,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and the$
+inspector offered to put one of our men on duty here, but Sir John$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt hear of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took a professional look at the house, and pointed to its dark upper$
+windows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That house is asleep‚M-^@M-^Tyou needn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about that,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\besides,$
+it‚M-^@M-^Yll be daylight in two hours, and a burglar wants that time to get$
+home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy paused irresolutely. It seemed absurd to wait any longer, and$
+besides, to be consistent he must be prepared to adopt this watchman$
+r√¥le every night.$
+$
+There was no particular reason why Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy should choose$
+this night or any other. He had half expected to see Cartwright and was$
+agreeably disappointed that he did not loom into view.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre right,‚M-^@M-^] he said to the policeman. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll walk along down$
+the road with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They must have walked a quarter of a mile, and were standing chatting at$
+the corner of the street, when a sound, borne clearly on the night air,$
+made both men look back in the direction whence they had come. They saw$
+two glaring spots of light somewhere in the vicinity of the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+house.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a car,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, ‚M-^@M-^\what is it doing there at this time$
+of the morning? There is nobody sick in the house, is there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head. Already he had begun to walk back, and the$
+policeman, sensing something wrong, kept him company. They had covered$
+half the distance which separated them from the car, when it began to$
+move toward them, gathering speed. It flashed past and Timothy saw$
+nothing save the driver, for the hood was raised and its canvas blinds$
+hid whatever passenger it carried.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It came in from the other end of the avenue,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman$
+unnecessarily. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe Sir John is going a long journey and is starting$
+early.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell would have told me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, troubled. ‚M-^@M-^\I nearly took$
+a chance and made a jump for that car.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was one of the few chances Timothy did not take, and one that he$
+bitterly regretted afterwards.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical policeman, ‚M-^@M-^\I should have been looking$
+for the ambulance for you now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was no longer satisfied to play the r√¥le of the silent watcher.$
+When he came to the house he went boldly through the gate and up the$
+drive, and his warrant for the intrusion was the officer who followed$
+him. It was then that he saw the open window of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys room, and his$
+heart leapt into his mouth. He quickened his step, but just as he came$
+under the window, she appeared, and Timothy sighed his relief.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is that you?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a low worried voice; ‚M-^@M-^\is that Mr. Anderson?$
+Thank heaven you‚M-^@M-^Yve come! Wait, I will come down and open the door for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked to the entrance, and presently the door was opened and the$
+girl, dressed in a wrapper, appeared. She tried to keep her voice$
+steady, but the strain of the past half-hour had been too much for her,$
+and she was on the verge of tears when Timothy put his arm about her$
+shaking shoulders and forced her down into a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and tell us what has happened.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at the officer and tried to speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a servant,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman; ‚M-^@M-^\perhaps he knows something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A man dressed in shirt and trousers was coming down the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can‚M-^@M-^Yt make him hear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\or Lady Maxell, either.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know, sir. The young lady woke me and asked me to rouse Sir$
+John.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sorry I am so silly. I am probably$
+making a lot of trouble over nothing. It happened nearly an hour ago, I$
+was asleep and I heard a sound; thought I was dreaming of what happened$
+last night. It sounded like two shots, but, whatever it was, it woke$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know. I thought I heard them too,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you were out there all the time?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and put out her hand$
+to him.$
+$
+For that look she gave him Timothy would have stayed out the three$
+hundred and sixty-five nights in the year.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I lay for a very long time, thinking that the sound would wake my$
+uncle, but I heard nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is your room near Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys?‚M-^@M-^] asked the policeman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, mine is on this side of the building; Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+sleep on the other side. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what it was, but something alarmed$
+me and filled me with terror‚M-^@M-^Tsomething that made my flesh go rough and$
+cold‚M-^@M-^Toh, it was horrible!‚M-^@M-^] she shuddered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt endure it any longer, so I got out of bed and went out into$
+the corridor to wake uncle. Just then I heard a sound outside my window,$
+but I was just too terrified to look out. Then I heard a motor-car and$
+footsteps on the path outside. I went to Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys door and knocked,$
+but got no answer. Then I tried Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys door, but there was no$
+answer there either. So I went to Johnson‚M-^@M-^Ys room and woke him;‚M-^@M-^] she$
+looked at Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Tthought that you might be there, so I came$
+back to the open window and looked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Show me Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman to the servant, and the$
+three men passed up the stairs, followed by the girl.$
+$
+The door which the man indicated was locked, and even when the policeman$
+hammered on the panel there was no response.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think the key of my door will unlock almost any of the room doors,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the girl suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John told me once that all the room locks$
+were made on the same plan.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She went away and came back with a key. The policeman fitted it in the$
+lock and opened the door, feeling for and finding the electric switch as$
+he entered. The room was empty, and apparently the bed had not been$
+occupied.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where does that door lead?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That leads to Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\there is a key on$
+this side.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This door he found was open and again they found an empty room and a bed$
+which had not been slept in. They looked at one another.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Sir John be in his study till late?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is at the end of the corridor,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a broken voice, for she$
+felt that the study held some dreadful secret.$
+$
+This door was locked too, locked from the inside. By now the policeman$
+was standing on no ceremony, and with a quick thrust of his shoulder he$
+broke the lock, and the door flew open.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us have a little light,‚M-^@M-^] he said, unconsciously copying words which$
+had been spoken in that room an hour before.$
+$
+The room was empty, but here at any rate was evidence. The safe stood$
+open, the fireplace was filled with glowing ashes, and the air of the$
+room was pungent with the scent of burnt paper.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is this?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy, pointing to the ground.$
+$
+The floor of the study was covered with a thick, biscuit-coloured$
+carpet, and ‚M-^@M-^\this‚M-^@M-^] was a round, dark stain which was still wet. The$
+policeman went on his knees and examined it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is blood,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly; ‚M-^@M-^\there‚M-^@M-^Ys another patch near the door.$
+Where does this door lead? Catch that girl, she‚M-^@M-^Ys fainting!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was just in time to slip his arm round Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys waist before she$
+collapsed. By this time the household was aroused, and a woman servant$
+was on the spot to take charge of Mary. When Timothy had rejoined the$
+policeman, that officer had discovered where the door led.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You go down a stairway into the garden,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It looks as if two$
+shots were fired here. Look, there‚M-^@M-^Ys the mark of both of them on the$
+wall.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you suggest that two people have been killed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The policeman nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\One was shot in the middle of the room, and one was probably shot on$
+the way to the door. What do you make of this?‚M-^@M-^] and he held up a bag,$
+discoloured and weather-worn, with a handle to which was fastened a long$
+length of rusty wire.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is empty,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, examining the contents of the little$
+grip which, up till an hour before, had held John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys most$
+jealously guarded secrets.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll use this ‚M-^@M-^Yphone,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better stay by, Mr.$
+Anderson. We shall want your evidence‚M-^@M-^Tit will be important. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+often we have a man watching outside a house where a murder is$
+committed‚M-^@M-^Tprobably two.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The sun had risen before the preliminary interrogation and the search of$
+the house and grounds had been concluded. Blewitt the detective, who had$
+taken charge of the case, came into the dining-room, where a worried$
+servant was serving coffee for the investigators, and dropped down on to$
+a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue and there‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue alone,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and drew from$
+his pocket a soft hat. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you recognise this, Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that was worn last night by the man I spoke to you$
+about.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I could swear to it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Where did you find it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Outside,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective; ‚M-^@M-^\and that is all we have to go on. There$
+is no sign of any body. My first theory stands.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You believe that the murderer carried Sir John and Lady Maxell into the$
+car and drove away with them?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\but that pre-supposes that$
+the chauffeur was in the plot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He may have been and he may have been terrorised,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Even a taxi-driver will be obliging if you stick a gun in his stomach.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Miss Maxell have heard‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] began Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell heard,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\but was afraid to look out.$
+She also heard two shots. My theory is that Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+were killed, that the murderer first locked both the bedrooms, went$
+through Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys papers, presumably to discover something$
+incriminating himself, and to destroy such documents.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But why not leave the bodies?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because without the bodies no indictment of murder could hold against$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson turned as the girl came in. She was looking very tired,$
+but she was calmer than she had been earlier in the morning.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is there any news?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have searched every inch of the ground,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated to ask the question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am afraid,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy gently, ‚M-^@M-^\that there is very little hope.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But have you searched everywhere?‚M-^@M-^] insisted the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everywhere,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+Soon after, Timothy took the girl away to an hotel for breakfast and to$
+arrange for a room, and the house was left in charge of the police.$
+Later came the famous detective Gilborne, who made an independent$
+search, but he, like his predecessors, failed to discover any further$
+evidence, because he also knew nothing of the disused well, which lay$
+hidden under a rubbish heap.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XV$
+$
+$
+WHO killed Sir John Maxell and his wife?$
+$
+Where had their bodies been hidden? These were the two questions which$
+were to agitate England for the traditional space of nine days. For one$
+day, at any rate, they formed the sole topic of speculation amongst the$
+intelligent section of fifty million people.$
+$
+The first question was easier to answer than the second. It was obvious$
+to the newsmen that the murderer was Cartwright, whose threats of$
+vengeance were recalled and whose appearance at Bournemouth had been$
+described at second-hand by the detective in charge of the case.$
+First-hand information was for the moment denied the pressmen, for$
+Timothy, fully dressed, lay on his bed in a sound sleep. Happily for$
+him, neither then nor later did any of the enterprising newspaper men$
+associate the ‚M-^@M-^\A. C.‚M-^@M-^] in his name with the wanted criminal. He was at$
+least spared that embarrassment.$
+$
+But the story of his vigil as ‚M-^@M-^\a friend of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] was in print long$
+before he woke up to find a small and impatient army of reporters$
+waiting to interview him. He answered the reporters‚M-^@M-^Y interrogations as$
+briefly as possible, bathed and changed and made his way to the hotel$
+where the girl was. She was leaving as he arrived, and the warmth of her$
+greeting almost banished the depression which lay upon him. She put her$
+arm through his so naturally that he did not realise his wonderful$
+fortune.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve got something to tell you,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\unless you know already.$
+All my money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped with a gasp.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean that?‚M-^@M-^] he said seriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is true,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe it was very little and my loss is$
+so insignificant compared with the other awful affair that I am not$
+worrying about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John had money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just seen his lawyers,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\they have been to the bank$
+and there is not a hundred pounds to his credit, and that amount will be$
+absorbed by the cheques he has drawn. He drew a very, very large sum,$
+including my money, from the bank two days ago. You know,‚M-^@M-^] she went on,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that Sir John contemplated leaving for America? He had already$
+given me a hint, asking me how long it would take me to pack my$
+belongings, and I fancy that had something to do with the telegram he$
+received‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Announcing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys escape,‚M-^@M-^] nodded Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was so kind and so gentle,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, her eyes filling with$
+tears, ‚M-^@M-^\that to me he was more like a father. Oh, it is awful, awful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you?‚M-^@M-^] asked the agitated Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do? Good$
+heavens! It is dreadful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall have to work,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl practically and with a little$
+smile. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that will kill me. Hundreds of thousands of girls$
+have to work for their living, Timothy, and I shall have to work for$
+mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy drew a long breath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not if I can help it, you won‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sure I shall make a$
+lot of money. I can feel it in my bones. If a man takes a job‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt talk like that,‚M-^@M-^] she said, pressing his arm, ‚M-^@M-^\and anyway,$
+how could I let you help me or keep me? That sort of thing isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+done‚M-^@M-^Tnot by nice girls.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She laughed, but became sober again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know that Sir John was very much interested in you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In me?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I told you so the other day. I think he liked you, because he was$
+saying how uncomfortable you must be at Vermont House, living in that$
+queer little room of yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did he know I was living at Vermont House?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Vermont House happens to be Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys property,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\In fact, I$
+think it is the only realisable piece of property he has, now that the$
+money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What shall you do immediately?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I think the first step is to get out of$
+this hotel, which is much too expensive for me. I have a few pounds in$
+the bank, but that won‚M-^@M-^Yt last very long.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At his earnest entreaty she agreed to see a solicitor and appoint him to$
+save whatever was possible from the wreckage of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys estate. Two$
+hours passed like as many minutes, until Timothy remembered that he had$
+an appointment with a London reporter‚M-^@M-^Tone Brennan. Brennan he had known$
+in his cinema days, and Timothy literally fell upon his neck.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to tell the boys that hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt already been told,‚M-^@M-^] he said,$
+putting down the newspaper which Brennan handed to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I am as anxious$
+for news as you are. Have there been any developments?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter, ‚M-^@M-^\except that Sir John had no money at the$
+bank and no money could be found in the house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I know,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all his securities were drawn out two days ago.$
+That was the stuff that Cartwright was after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does Miss Maxell know‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Brennan began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does know and she took it like a brick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was about twenty thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] Brennan went on. ‚M-^@M-^\The only other$
+clue the police have is that the safe was opened by Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicate$
+key. The old man had two sets made, one of which he used to keep in his$
+combination safe in his bedroom and the other he carried around with$
+him. Miss Maxell told a story that the night before the murder Lady$
+Maxell asked her to secure possession of the keys in order to open a$
+bureau.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see. Is it suggested that Lady Maxell detached the key of the safe$
+and that it was she who opened it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one theory,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\the police have miles of ‚M-^@M-^Yem!$
+They‚M-^@M-^Yve got everything except the bodies and the murderer. Now come out$
+with that story, Anderson! You must know a great deal more than you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+told, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym simply without a new fact that these evening papers$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got, to hang my story on. Why did Cartwright come to your room,$
+anyway? Do you know him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was an acquaintance of my father‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and perhaps he thought I knew Maxell better than I did.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sounds pretty thin,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter. ‚M-^@M-^\Why should he come to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose I am the only person he knew or knew about,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+patiently. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose he‚M-^@M-^Yd been all round Bournemouth trying to find a$
+familiar name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the reporter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I was a kid when he went to gaol. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+imagine I knew him at all, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had gone out to meet the girl, forgetting to take his watch, and now$
+he was looking round for it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a theory,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Lady Maxell isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+dead at all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Cartwright killed Maxell and Lady Maxell witnessed the murder.$
+Suppose this fellow had to decide whether he would kill the witness or$
+whether he would go away with her? You said the motor-car which came to$
+the house in the middle of the night was the same as that in which Lady$
+Maxell came home. Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely that she should have told the$
+murderer, for some reason or other, that the car was coming, because$
+evidently she had arranged for it to come, and that they went away$
+together? Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely, too, that she was in the plot, and that, so$
+far from being a victim, she was one of the criminals? We know her$
+antecedents. There was some trouble over her stabbing a young American,$
+Reggie van Rhyn. In fact, most of the evidence seems to incriminate her.$
+There is the key, for example. Who else but she could have taken the$
+duplicate key? Doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt it look as though she planned the whole thing,$
+and that her accomplice came in at the last moment to help her get away$
+and possibly to settle Sir John?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take the incident of the two locked bedrooms. Obviously somebody who$
+lived in the house and who knew the family routine must have done that.$
+Both Sir John and Lady Maxell were in the habit of fastening their doors$
+at night, and the servants did not go into the bedrooms unless they were$
+rung for. It seems to me fairly clear that Lady Maxell locked the doors$
+so that the suspicions of the servants should not be aroused in the$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If I had your powers of deduction,‚M-^@M-^] said the admiring Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+should never miss a winner. Where the blazes is my watch?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try under the pillow,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I never put it there,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy, but nevertheless turned the$
+pillow over and stood gaping.$
+$
+For beneath the pillow was a long, stout envelope with a tell-tale blood$
+stain in one corner.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake!‚M-^@M-^] breathed Timothy, and took up the package.$
+$
+It bore no address and was sealed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What on earth is this?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can tell you what those stains are,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Brennan. ‚M-^@M-^\Is$
+there any name on it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open it,‚M-^@M-^] suggested the reporter, and the other obeyed.$
+$
+The contents were even more astonishing, for they consisted of a thick$
+pad of money. They were new Bank of England notes and were bound about$
+by a tight band of paper. On the band was written in Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+handwriting:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Proceeds of the sale of stocks held in trust for Miss Mary$
+    Maxell. ¬£21,300.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The detective in charge of the case was a man of many theories. But his$
+new theory was an uncomfortable one for Timothy Anderson.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This puts a new light upon the case,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+being perfectly frank with you, Mr. Anderson, that the new light isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+very favourable to you. Here you are, outside the building when the$
+crime is committed. You are seen by a policeman a few minutes after the$
+shots are fired, and a portion of the money stolen from the house is$
+discovered under your pillow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Discovered by me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\in the presence of a witness. And are$
+you suggesting that, whilst I was with your policeman, I was also$
+driving the car, or that I was wearing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys cap which was found$
+in the grounds? Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve the finger-print of your man and you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+at liberty to compare it with mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a finger-print anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\it is the print$
+of a knuckle and we do not keep a record of knuckles. No, I admit that$
+the motor-car conflicts a little bit with my theory. Have you any$
+suggestion to offer?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The only suggestion I can make,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is that Cartwright, in a$
+hurry to get away and knowing the position of my room, hid the money$
+there for fear he should be caught with the goods. At any rate, if I$
+were the criminal I would not hide a bloodstained envelope under my$
+pillow. I should at least have the intelligence to burn the envelope and$
+put the money where the servants of this house could not find it. Why,$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt you see,‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously, ‚M-^@M-^\that any of the servants at this$
+boarding-house would have found the envelope if I hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The detective scratched his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a very queer case.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And it is being investigated by very queer people,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+irritably.$
+$
+A little further investigation, however, relieved Timothy of all$
+suspicion. He had not returned to the house until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock that$
+morning. The maid, who had taken him a cup of tea at eight, noticing$
+that he had been out all night, thought it was an excellent opportunity$
+to straighten the room to ‚M-^@M-^\get it off her mind,‚M-^@M-^] as she said. She did$
+not remake the bed, but had tidied it. Whilst sweeping she had seen the$
+envelope lying on the floor near the open window and had picked it up$
+and, for want of a better place, thinking ‚M-^@M-^\it was private‚M-^@M-^] had slipped$
+it under Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys pillow.$
+$
+As Timothy had not been out of sight of the police since the tragedy$
+until his return to his lodgings, there could be no suggestion that he$
+had any part in hiding the envelope. Whatever irritation he felt was$
+dispelled by his large and generous satisfaction when the poverty which$
+threatened Mary was averted. But why should Cartwright hide the money$
+there? Why should he stop in his headlong flight to come to the window,$
+as evidently he did, and throw the package into the room? There were a$
+hundred places where he might have left it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That cousin stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt work,‚M-^@M-^] thought Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and if you think$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys going to rely upon his relationship with me and can use me to look$
+after his money, he‚M-^@M-^Ys made one large mistake.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw the girl again at the official inquiry, and met her on the day$
+after. She was going to Bath where she had some distant relations, and$
+they had met to say good-bye.$
+$
+It was a gloomy occasion‚M-^@M-^Tless gloomy for Timothy than for the girl,$
+because he was already planning a move to the town in which she was$
+taking up her quarters. This cheerful view was banished, however, when$
+she explained that her stay in Bath was merely a temporary expedient.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew has wired asking me to come‚M-^@M-^Tand it seems as good a place$
+as any for a few months. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I shall stay here any longer,‚M-^@M-^]$
+she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want a change of air and a change of scene. Timothy, I feel$
+that I shall never get over Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never is a very long time, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently, and she could$
+only wonder at the tender kindness in his voice.$
+$
+She had little time to wonder, however, for she had a proposition to$
+make to him and she hardly knew how to reduce it to words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you‚M-^@M-^Tare you‚M-^@M-^Tworking?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys broad smile answered her plainly that he was not.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact is,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt quite decided what I am going$
+to do. If you were going down to Bath for good, I was going down to Bath$
+also. Maybe I could start a druggist‚M-^@M-^Ys or buy a store, or run errands$
+for somebody. I am the most accommodating worker.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she began and stopped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he repeated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had an idea that maybe you would like to go on and conduct an$
+independent search‚M-^@M-^Tindependent of the police, I mean‚M-^@M-^Tand find$
+something about the man who killed Sir John, and perhaps bring him to$
+justice. You know, I think you are clever enough,‚M-^@M-^] she went on$
+hurriedly, ‚M-^@M-^\and it would be work after your own heart.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was looking at her steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly, ‚M-^@M-^\but that involves spending a$
+whole lot of money. What misguided person do you suggest would send me$
+out on that kind of job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I thought‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated, and then a little incoherently,$
+‚M-^@M-^\You see, I have the money‚M-^@M-^Tmainly through you‚M-^@M-^Tmy own money, I mean. I$
+feel I have a duty to my poor uncle and I could trust you to do your$
+very best. I could afford it, Timothy‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe laid her hand on his arm and$
+looked up at him almost beseechingly‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\indeed I can afford it. I have$
+more money than I shall ever spend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He patted her hand softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is just the kind of job I should like, and with$
+anybody‚M-^@M-^Ys money but yours, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd be out of the country in two shakes,$
+looking for Mr. Cartwright in the most expensive cities of the world.$
+But, my dear, I cannot accept your commission, because I know just what$
+lies behind it. You think I‚M-^@M-^Ym a restless, rather shiftless sort of$
+fellow, and you want to give me a good time‚M-^@M-^Twith your money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\thank you, but, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was disappointed and for a moment a little hurt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Would two hundred pounds‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she suggested timidly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not your two hundred,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\That lawyer of yours should take$
+better care of your money, Mary. He shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt allow you to make these$
+tempting offers to young men,‚M-^@M-^] he was smiling now. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you go abroad?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps‚M-^@M-^Tsome day,‚M-^@M-^] she said vaguely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John wanted me to go‚M-^@M-^Tand I$
+feel that I should be pleasing him. Some day, yes, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll go over at the same time as you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought of$
+taking a chance in Paris for a while‚M-^@M-^Tyou can make big money in Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In‚M-^@M-^Ta while?‚M-^@M-^] she smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a minute,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if the horse and the jockey are of$
+the same way of thinking. I know a fellow who races pretty extensively$
+in France. He has a horse called Flirt‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held out her hand for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, you‚M-^@M-^Yre incorrigible,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+She did not see him again for twelve months, not indeed until, after a$
+winter spent in Madeira, she put her foot over the gangway of the s.s.$
+_Tigilanes_ and met the quizzical smile of the youth who was waiting to$
+receive her.$
+$
+For Timothy had been in Funchal a month, seeing but unseen, since Mary$
+was generally in bed before the Casino woke up and play reached any$
+exciting level.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVI$
+$
+$
+TIMOTHY sat now on an upturned trunk, his elbows on the rails of the$
+s.s. _Tigilanes_ and his speculative eye roving the river front of$
+Liverpool.$
+$
+It was the last hour of the voyage, and Timothy, who had left Funchal$
+with four hundred pounds in his pocket-book, had exactly three genuine$
+shillings and a five-milreis piece of dubious quality.$
+$
+A man strolled along the deck and fell in at his side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cleaned you out last night, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^] he asked sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh? Oh, yes, I believe they did. That red-haired man had all the luck$
+and most of the cards.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He smiled and Timothy had a swift, happy smile that brought tired little$
+ridges under his eyes. He was not only good-looking and young, but he$
+was interesting.$
+$
+The man at his side took the cigar from his teeth and looked at it$
+before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, you know they were crooks‚M-^@M-^Tthey work this coast line$
+regularly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round, shocked and pained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say? Crooks! What, that little red-haired fellow who has been$
+trying to pick a quarrel with me all the voyage, and the tall,$
+nice-looking Englishman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His companion nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember the Captain warned us not to play cards‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They always do that to be on the safe side,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, but he was$
+obviously uneasy. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I knew they were crooks‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Knew! Good lord! Anybody will tell you. Ask the purser. Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been stung and you can do nothing. The best thing to do is to grin and$
+bear your losses. It is experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy felt the three honest shillings in his pocket and whistled$
+dismally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I were sure‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned abruptly away and raced down the main companion-way to the$
+purser‚M-^@M-^Ys little office under the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Macleod, I want to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir,‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tall pursers are a little suspicious,‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\anything wrong with$
+your bill?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No‚M-^@M-^Tnot unless his name‚M-^@M-^Ys Bill. Shall I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser opened the half-door and admitted him to the sanctuary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are two fellows aboard this packet‚M-^@M-^Ta red-haired fellow named$
+Chelwyn and a disguised duke named Brown‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you know about ‚M-^@M-^Yem?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser made a face. It was intended to convey his lack of real$
+interest in either.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll put it plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said the patient Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Are they crooks?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They play cards,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser diplomatically.$
+$
+He desired at this the eleventh hour to avoid scandal, explanations, and$
+such other phenomena which he associated in his mind with the$
+confrontation of the wise men and their dupes. That sort of thing$
+brought the Line into disrepute, and indirectly reflected upon the$
+ship‚M-^@M-^Ys officers. Besides, the ship was making port, and, like all$
+pursers, he was up to his eyes in work and frantically anxious to clear$
+it off in a minimum time so that he could take a train to his little$
+villa at Lytham, where his family was established.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mr. Anderson, if you‚M-^@M-^Yve been stung,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but the$
+captain gives fair warning the first night out of Cape Town and$
+Madeira‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys where you came aboard, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^Tand there were notices$
+posted up, both in the saloon and in the smoking-room. Have you lost$
+much?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up with some sympathy at the tall, athletic figure with the$
+tired, smiling eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I cleared up ¬£500 at the Funchal Casino,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I reckon I$
+have spent ¬£100 legitimately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The rest is gone, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, Mr. Anderson, I am$
+afraid I can do nothing. The best thing to do is to mark it down against$
+‚M-^@M-^XExperience‚M-^@M-^Y.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll forgive you for being philosophical about my losses,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you be kind enough to tell me the number of Mr. Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+cabin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two seventy-four,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\I say, Mr. Anderson, if I were you$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yd let the matter drop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you would, dear old thing,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, shaking him warmly by$
+the hand, ‚M-^@M-^\and if I were you I should let it drop too. But, as I am$
+me‚M-^@M-^T274, I think you said?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to make any trouble, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+alarmed purser. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve done our best to make you comfortable on the$
+voyage.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I did my best to pay for my ticket, so we‚M-^@M-^Yre quits,‚M-^@M-^] and with a$
+wave of his hand Timothy strode out of the cabin, dodged down past the$
+steward carrying up the luggage to the next deck, and walked swiftly$
+along the carpeted corridor till he found a little number-plate bearing$
+the figures ‚M-^@M-^\274.‚M-^@M-^] He knocked at the cabin door, and gruff voice said,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come in!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Chelwyn, the red-haired man, was in his shirt sleeves, fastening his$
+collar. Brown was sitting on the edge of his bunk, smoking a cigarette,$
+and Chelwyn, who had seen Timothy reflected in the mirror as he came in,$
+was first to recognise him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo, Mr. Anderson, do you want anything?‚M-^@M-^] he asked politely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sorry$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yve had such bad luck‚M-^@M-^Twhat the devil are you doing?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy had shut the door and slipped the bolt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I want something,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You want‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen. I thought you were playing straight, you fellows, or I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have played with you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym willing to take a chance, for that‚M-^@M-^Ys my motto$
+in life, dear lads, but there isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a chance to take when you‚M-^@M-^Yre playing$
+with crooks.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here,‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man, walking over to him and$
+emphasising his words with his forefinger against Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chest, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+kind of stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt amuse me. If you lose your money, lose it like a$
+sportsman and a gentleman, and don‚M-^@M-^Yt squeal.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Boys,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds from you, so step lively.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The suave Mr. Brown, who had been watching the scene with bored eyes,$
+stroking his drooping moustache the while, made a gentle entrance into$
+the conversation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym rather surprised, in fact, I am shocked, Mr. Anderson, that you$
+should take this line,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve lost your money fairly and$
+squarely‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys where you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy pleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling$
+you this. We‚M-^@M-^Yre very near the shore. Somewhere at the back of those$
+warehouses there‚M-^@M-^Ys certain to be a police organisation and a well-paid$
+magistrate. You are going to have a grand opportunity of appearing in$
+the respectable part of the court as a prosecutor, for I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to beat$
+you up‚M-^@M-^Tfirst you,‚M-^@M-^] he pointed to the red-haired Chelwyn, ‚M-^@M-^\and then$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre going to beat me up, are you?‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man and made$
+a quick dive.$
+$
+It was not pretty to watch, unless you took an interest in fighting.$
+They closed for a second and something jolted twice under Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw.$
+He fell back against the cabin partition. He leapt again, but Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+fist met him half-way, and he never really felt what hit him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve won this fight,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I award myself a purse of four$
+hundred pounds. Do you take any interest in these proceedings. Brown?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other man had not moved from his bunk, but now he rose and lifted$
+his dazed companion to his feet.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yd better pay this fellow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll see him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] mumbled the other, but Brown was apparently the$
+brains of the organisation and had merely mentioned his intention of$
+paying out of sheer politeness to his companion.$
+$
+He took a thick pocket-book from his hip pocket and counted out the$
+notes, and Timothy picked them up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll fix you for this,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn, mopping his bleeding lip. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+taken this from me‚M-^@M-^Tnot him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy as he unbolted the door and stepped$
+out.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Some day I‚M-^@M-^Yll get you,‚M-^@M-^] said the livid man, and the finger he pointed$
+at Timothy was shaking with anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He ascended the companion-way feeling remarkably cheerful, and met the$
+purser coming down. That officer regarded him even more suspiciously$
+than ever. But as there were no signs of the fray upon him, the purser$
+went to his cabin relieved, and Timothy passed out to relieve his$
+feelings by the side of the rail. So he sat whilst the big liner was$
+brought alongside the wharf, and then he heard his name spoken and$
+jumped up, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just wanted to tell you, Timothy, in case I did not see you on the$
+train,‚M-^@M-^] she remarked, ‚M-^@M-^\that Mrs. Renfrew has decided not to go back to$
+Bath but to go on to Paris almost immediately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good for Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Bath or Paris will find me$
+hanging around. I nearly came down to you just now to borrow my fare to$
+Bath.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice, ‚M-^@M-^\did you lose all the money you$
+won in Funchal?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy rubbed his nose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt exactly lose it,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I lent it and it has just been$
+repaid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt think it proper your travelling on the same boat.$
+She thinks you ought not to have come to Madeira after me‚M-^@M-^Tus.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was mischief in Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes, in spite of the solemnity of her$
+tone.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about what Mrs. Renfrew thinks,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Why,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre almost as badly off for cousins as I am.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As you are?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any cousins?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hundreds of ‚M-^@M-^Yem,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy glibly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who are they?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, interested.$
+$
+She had reached a stage in their friendship when his relatives were$
+immensely interesting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know their names,‚M-^@M-^] lied Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt give ‚M-^@M-^Yem names but$
+numbers‚M-^@M-^Tone, two, three, four, etc.‚M-^@M-^Tjust at that moment I was thinking$
+of number seventy-nine‚M-^@M-^Tgood morning, Mrs. Renfrew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew was severe and thin, with a yellow face and hooked nose.$
+She was a member of one of the best, if not the best, families in Bath,$
+and it was an unfailing source of pride that she did not know the people$
+that other people knew.$
+$
+Mary watched the encounter with dancing eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I have the pleasure of your company to London?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mrs.$
+Renfrew.$
+$
+She invariably made a point of leaving Mary out, and indeed sustained$
+the pleasant fiction that Mary had no existence on board the ship.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The pleasure will be mine,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I am not travelling with you$
+to London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He said this so innocently that Mrs. Renfrew was in the middle of her$
+next observation before she had any idea that the remark had an$
+offensive interpretation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You seem to have had a very unfortunate experience‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Happily a very hot-looking steward made his appearance at that moment$
+and called Mrs. Renfrew away. She gathered up her charge and with a$
+withering glance at Timothy departed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson, feeling particularly happy, was one of the$
+first to land and strolled along the quay-side waiting within view of$
+the gangway for Mary to disembark. Immediately above him towered the$
+high decks of the _Tigilanes_‚M-^@M-^Ta fact of which he was reminded when,$
+with a crash, a heavy wooden bucket dropped so close to his head that it$
+grazed his shoulder. It was a large bucket, and, dropped from that$
+height, might have caused him considerable physical distress.$
+$
+He looked up.$
+$
+The two card-players with whom he had had some argument were lolling$
+over the rail, their faces turned in quite another direction and talking$
+earnestly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hi!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+They were deaf, it appeared, for they still continued their discussion.$
+A deck hand was passing with a crate load of oranges; one fell out and$
+Timothy picked it up. The attention of Messrs. Chelwyn and Brown was$
+still directed elsewhere, and with a little swing of his arm Timothy$
+sent the orange upon its swift and unerring course. It caught the$
+red-haired man square in the side of the face and burst, and he jumped$
+round with an oath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve dropped your bucket,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sweetly. ‚M-^@M-^\Shall I throw it at$
+you or will you come down and get it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man said something violent, but his companion pulled him away, and$
+Timothy went to look for a seat with peace in his heart.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVII$
+$
+$
+THE train was crowded, but he secured a corner seat in one of the$
+cell-like compartments. It was empty when he entered, but immediately$
+after, to his surprise, Brown and Chelwyn followed him in and deposited$
+their goods upon three seats that they might in the manner of all$
+experienced travellers, occupy breathing space for three at the cost of$
+two tickets.$
+$
+They took no notice of Timothy until the train drew out and he wondered$
+what their game was. It was hardly likely that they would start any$
+rough work with him after their experience of the morning and less$
+likely because these boat trains were well policed.$
+$
+Clear of the Riverside Station the smooth Englishman leant forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you will forget and forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I have nothing to forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown with a smile, ‚M-^@M-^\is very precipitate‚M-^@M-^Twhich$
+means hasty,‚M-^@M-^] he explained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I thought it meant crooked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A spasm contorted the features of Mr. Chelwyn, but he said nothing. As$
+for Brown, he laughed. He laughed heartily but spuriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys not a bad joke,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but to tell you the truth, we mistook$
+you for‚M-^@M-^Tone of us, and my friend and I thought it would be a good joke$
+to get the better of you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was and it wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown, not easily nonplussed. ‚M-^@M-^\Of$
+course, we intended restoring the money to you before you left the$
+ship.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Naturally,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I never thought you would do anything else.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Only you know you rather spoilt our little _esprit_.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If the conversation is to develop in a foreign language,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would only remark: _Honi soit qui mal y pense_,‚M-^@M-^] and the polite Mr.$
+Brown laughed again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You do not mind if my friend and I have a little quiet game by$
+ourselves, if,‚M-^@M-^] he said humorously, ‚M-^@M-^\we swindle one another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I have no objection to watching, but if,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\you should suddenly draw my attention whilst your$
+friend‚M-^@M-^Ys head is turned, to the ease with which I could win a hundred$
+pounds by picking the lady, or discovering the little pea under the$
+little shell, or show me a way of getting rich from any of the other$
+devices which the children of the public schools find so alluring at the$
+country fair, I shall be under the painful necessity of slapping you$
+violently on the wrist.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Thereafter the conversation languished until the train had run through$
+Crewe and was approaching Rugby. It was here that Mr. Brown stopped in$
+the midst of a long, learned discussion on English politics to offer his$
+cigarette-case to Timothy. Timothy chose a cigarette and put it in his$
+pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one of the best Egyptian brands made,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown casually.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Best for you or best for me?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] It was the red-haired Chelwyn who addressed him for the first$
+time. ‚M-^@M-^\What have you to be afraid of? You‚M-^@M-^Yre as scared as a cat! Do you$
+think we want to poison you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Brown produced a flask and poured a modicum of whisky into the cup$
+and handed it to his companion, then he drank himself. Then, without$
+invitation he poured a little more into the cup and offered it to$
+Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let bygones be bygones,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no desire to be a bygone,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I would much rather be$
+a herenow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Nevertheless, he took the cup and smelt it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Butyl chloride,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\has a distinctive odour. I suppose you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+call it by its technical name, and to you it is just vulgarly ‚M-^@M-^Xa$
+knock-out drop.‚M-^@M-^Y Really,‚M-^@M-^] he said, handing back the cup, ‚M-^@M-^\you boys are$
+so elementary. Where did you learn it all‚M-^@M-^Tfrom the movies?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The red-haired man half rose from his seat with a growl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply, and with a jerk of his hand he flung$
+open the carriage door.$
+$
+The men shrank back at the sight of the rapidly running line, and at the$
+certainty of death which awaited any who left the train on that side of$
+the carriage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Start something,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yll undertake to put either one$
+or both of you on to the line. We‚M-^@M-^Yre going at about sixty miles an hour,$
+and a fellow that went out there wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be taking a chance. Now is$
+there going to be a rough house?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Close the door, close the door,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown nervously. ‚M-^@M-^\What a$
+stupid idea, Mr. Anderson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy swung the door to and the man moved up towards him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym just going to put it to you plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said Brown. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve made$
+the voyage out to the Cape and the voyage back and the only mug we met$
+was you. What we won from you just about paid our expenses, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+putting it to you, as a sportsman and a gentleman, that you should let$
+us have half of that stuff back.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The sportsman in me admires your nerve,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I suppose$
+it is the gentleman part that returns an indignant ‚M-^@M-^XNo!‚M-^@M-^Y to your$
+interesting observation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brown turned to his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, that‚M-^@M-^Ys that, Len,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yll just have to let the money$
+go. It is a pity,‚M-^@M-^] he said wistfully and his companion grunted.$
+$
+That ended the conversation so far as the journey was concerned, and$
+Timothy heard no more until he was in the gloomy courtyard at Euston$
+Station and stepping into his taxi.$
+$
+To his surprise it was the red-haired man who approached him, and$
+something in his manner prevented Timothy from taking the action which$
+he otherwise would have thought necessary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here, young fellow,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you watch Brown‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys wild.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not exactly tame,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt take any notice of me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man a little bitterly. ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+engaged in the rough work. I should have got two hundred out of your$
+money‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys what made me so wild. Brown paid all my expenses and gives$
+me ten pound a week and a commission. It sounds funny to you, doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it, but it is the truth,‚M-^@M-^] and somehow Timothy knew that the man was not$
+lying.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys finished with me‚M-^@M-^Tsays I am a hoodoo,‚M-^@M-^] said the little man. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve got out of five weeks‚M-^@M-^Y work? Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand and disclosed two ten-pound notes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys dangerous,‚M-^@M-^] he warned Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you make any mistake$
+about that. I was only wild because I was losing my money, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys wild$
+because you‚M-^@M-^Yve got fresh with him and caught him out every time. Good$
+night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He felt in his pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying, it is a plausible lie and one that pleases me,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\This will salve my conscience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped two notes into the man‚M-^@M-^Ys hands.$
+$
+Chelwyn was speechless for a moment. Then he asked:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And where are you staying in London, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel,‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll remember that. I$
+shall hear if anything is going on and I‚M-^@M-^Yll ‚M-^@M-^Yphone you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+gentleman, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So Mr. Brown said,‚M-^@M-^] remarked Timothy and drove off, feeling unusually$
+cheerful.$
+$
+If Timothy could be cheerful under the depressing conditions which$
+prevailed on the night of his arrival in London, he was a veritable$
+pattern of cheer. A drizzling rain was falling as the taxi squeaked its$
+way through a labyrinth of mean streets. He had glimpses of$
+wretched-looking people, grotesque of shape and unreal, through the$
+rain-blurred window of the cab.$
+$
+Then suddenly the character of the streets changed, and he was in a$
+broad street twinkling with light. There was a glimpse of trees, wide$
+open spaces, dotted with light. The street grew busier and the traffic$
+thicker, then suddenly the cab turned again into semi-darkness and$
+pulled up before the hotel.$
+$
+A porter opened the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do I think of Madeira?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy of the astonished man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had time to think. Will I be staying long in London? No. What$
+are my opinions of the political crisis which has arisen in my absence?$
+I would rather not say.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It takes a great deal to upset the equilibrium of a well-conducted hall$
+man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you booked your room?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Timothy meekly admitted that he had.$
+$
+He woke to a London much more beautiful, to a vista of old-world$
+buildings such as Cruikshank loved to draw, to a green square and$
+glimpses of greener trees.$
+$
+Mary was staying at the Carlton, but he had arranged to meet her for$
+lunch. He had not arranged to meet her dragon, but he knew she would be$
+there. He had breakfasted, and was on the point of leaving the hotel,$
+when Chelwyn came.$
+$
+To say that Timothy regretted his generosity of the night before would$
+be to do him an injustice. Nevertheless, he had some misgivings as to$
+whether he had not been a little too generous. The appearance of Mr.$
+Chelwyn, early in the morning, looking so spruce and confident, was in$
+itself a suspicious happening, though events proved that the suspicion$
+was unfounded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you alone for a moment, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^] asked the red-haired$
+man.$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come along to the drawing-room,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+It was the one public room which would be empty at that time of the$
+morning. Mr. Chelwyn deposited his hat and stick and brand-new yellow$
+gloves before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mr. Anderson, I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell you a few facts which will$
+surprise you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had a gold brick sent to you by your Uncle George in$
+Alaska, have you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy dubiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Because I‚M-^@M-^Ym not buying that$
+kind of fact.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man smiled and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is hardly likely I should try that stuff on you, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No,$
+this is a much more serious matter. Before I go any farther I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell$
+you that I am not asking for money. I am grateful to you for what you$
+did to me last night, Mr. Anderson. A crook has a wife and children the$
+same as anybody else. I have been in this funny business for ten years,$
+but now I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of it for good.‚M-^@M-^] He looked round and dropped his voice,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson, I told you last night that we‚M-^@M-^Yve been five or six weeks$
+away from England. Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt that sound strange to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is because you don‚M-^@M-^Yt know the game,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\As a rule,$
+when we‚M-^@M-^Yre working these liners, we go out to Cape Town and come back by$
+the next ship that sails. What do you think we stayed at Funchal$
+for‚M-^@M-^Tthere‚M-^@M-^Ys no money in short voyages‚M-^@M-^Tit‚M-^@M-^Ys all on the long run from$
+Madeira to Cape Town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt the slightest idea,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy wearily. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt even$
+remember seeing you in Funchal‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We laid low,‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That may be, but if you‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell me the interesting story of$
+your life, Ginger, I beg that you will cut it short‚M-^@M-^Tthe history, I$
+mean, not necessarily your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell it to you as quickly as possible,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt always work with Brown. In fact, I‚M-^@M-^Yve only worked with him about$
+three times before. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man with the broads‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The broads?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\With the cards,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I say that I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man$
+with the broads as some of the others. I‚M-^@M-^Yve got a bit of a reputation$
+for scrapping. I‚M-^@M-^Yve never left a pal in the lurch and I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been$
+ready for any ‚M-^@M-^Xrough house‚M-^@M-^Y that came along. About two months ago Brown$
+sent for me‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got a flat off Piccadilly and lives like a lord. He$
+told me he was going to Madeira on a special job, that he‚M-^@M-^Yd been$
+employed by a lady in Paris‚M-^@M-^Ta Madame Serpilot (you‚M-^@M-^Yd better write that$
+down in your pocket-book)‚M-^@M-^Tto shepherd a young lady who was coming over.$
+Mind you, there was no harm intended to the young lady, but the general$
+idea was that she might be accompanied by a man, and he was the fellow$
+who had to be looked after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was the lady‚M-^@M-^Ys name?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man without hesitation, ‚M-^@M-^\and you were the fellow$
+we were asked to put out of business. Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys idea was to break you;$
+then, when you got to London, one of his pals would have met you and$
+offered to lend you money. They‚M-^@M-^Yd have framed up a charge against you of$
+obtaining money by false pretences, and you would have been pinched.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys eyebrows rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Was this Mrs. Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys plan?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, but the man shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir, she gave just the details to Brown. She never said what was to$
+be done to you, according to him, but you were to be stopped going$
+around with the young lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you‚M-^@M-^Yve got me,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe she‚M-^@M-^Ys an old widow, but$
+Brown never told me much about her. He got instructions from her while$
+he was in Paris, but I never discovered how. I went to Madeira with him$
+because he knew I was tough‚M-^@M-^Tbut I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt tough enough,‚M-^@M-^] he added with a$
+dry smile.$
+$
+Timothy held out his hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ginger,‚M-^@M-^] he said solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\please forgive the orange!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mind that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\that‚M-^@M-^Ys all in the day‚M-^@M-^Ys work.$
+It made me a bit wild, and my eye‚M-^@M-^Ys feeling sore, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that$
+worry you. What you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to do now is to look out for Brown, because$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll have you as sure as death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll look out for Madame Serpilot, too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I think I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+to Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys not in Paris now, I can tell you that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\The wire$
+Brown got at Liverpool was from Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\is even more attractive than Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                             CHAPTER XVIII$
+$
+$
+CHELWYN left Timothy with something to think about. Who was Madame$
+Serpilot, this old lady who had such an interest in Mary travelling$
+alone? And why, oh! why had she left Paris for Monte Carlo at the fag$
+end of the season? For he and Mary had privately decided between them$
+that London and Paris should only be stopping places on the route to the$
+Riviera. Why should Madame Serpilot have changed her plans at the same$
+time? There was something more than a coincidence in this. At lunch-time$
+he had Mary to herself, her chaperon having a headache.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\can you tell me why we changed our plans on the boat$
+and decided to go straight on to Monte Carlo instead of staying in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said readily. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember my telling you about those$
+beautiful books of views that I saw on the ship?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where did you see them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I found them in my cabin one day. I think the steward must have left$
+them,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\They were most wonderful productions, full of coloured$
+prints and photographs‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt I tell you about them?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I remember,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\Found them in your cabin, eh? Well,$
+nobody left any beautiful or attractive pictures of Monte Carlo in my$
+berth, but I think that won‚M-^@M-^Yt stop me going on to Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was an opportunity she had been seeking for a week and she seized it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want to ask you something, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew told me$
+the other day that they call you ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson. Why is that,$
+Timothy?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because I take a chance, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been taking$
+chances all my life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not a gambler, Timothy, are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked gravely. ‚M-^@M-^\I know you$
+bet and play cards, but men do that for amusement, and somehow it is all$
+right. But when men start out to make a living, and actually make a$
+living, by games of chance, they somehow belong to another life and$
+another people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was silent.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre just too good to go that way, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she went on. ‚M-^@M-^\There are$
+lots of chances that a man can take in this world, in matching his$
+brains, his strength and his skill against other men, and when he wins$
+his stake is safe. He doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose it the next day or the next month,$
+and he‚M-^@M-^Ys picking winners all the time, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His first inclination was to be nettled. She was wounding the tender$
+skin of his vanity, and he was startled to discover how tender a skin$
+that was. All that she said was true and less than true. She could not$
+guess how far his mind and inclination were from commonplace labour and$
+how very little work came into the calculations of his future. He looked$
+upon a job as a thing not to be held and developed into something$
+better, but as a stopgap between two successful chances. He was almost$
+shocked when this truth came home to him. The girl was nervous, and$
+painfully anxious not to hurt him, and yet well aware that she was$
+rubbing a sore place.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, for your sake, as well as for mine, for you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of$
+mine, I want to be proud of you, to see you past this present phase of$
+life. Mrs. Renfrew speaks of you as a gambler, and says your name, even$
+at your age, is well known as one who would rather bet than buy. That$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt true, Timothy, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She put her hand on his and looked into his face. He did not meet her$
+eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that is true, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said steadily. ‚M-^@M-^\How it comes to be$
+true, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite know. I suppose I have drifted a little over the$
+line, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym grateful to you for pulling me up. Oh, no, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt regret$
+the past‚M-^@M-^Tit has all been useful‚M-^@M-^Tand I have made good on chances, but I$
+see there are other chances that a man can take than putting his money$
+on the pace of a horse or backing against zero. Maybe, when I get back$
+to London I‚M-^@M-^Yll settle down into a respectable citizen and keep hens or$
+something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was speaking seriously, though at first she thought he was being$
+sarcastic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you won‚M-^@M-^Yt gamble again?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He hesitated to reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I mean it isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair of me to ask$
+you. It is almost cruel,‚M-^@M-^] she smiled, ‚M-^@M-^\to let you go to Monte Carlo and$
+ask you not to put money on the tables. But promise me, Timothy, that$
+when I tell you to stop playing, you will stop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here‚M-^@M-^Ys my hand on it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, brightening up already at the$
+prospect of being allowed to gamble at all. ‚M-^@M-^\Hereafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He raised$
+his hand solemnly. ‚M-^@M-^\By the way,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, ‚M-^@M-^\do you know a lady named$
+Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I do not,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have never heard the name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have no relations or friends in France?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] she replied immediately.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What made you go to France at all?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\When I heard from you,$
+Mary, you talked about taking a holiday in Madeira before setting up$
+house in Bath, and the first thing I knew of your intention to go abroad$
+again was the letter you sent me just before I started for Madeira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wanted to go a year ago, after Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\then$
+Mrs. Renfrew couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt take the trip‚M-^@M-^Tone of her younger children had$
+measles.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has that woman children?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in an awed voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be absurd. Of course she has children. It was she who decided on$
+making the trip. She writes little articles in the _Bath County$
+Herald_‚M-^@M-^Ta local paper‚M-^@M-^Ton the care of children and all that sort of$
+thing. She‚M-^@M-^Ys not really a journalist, she is literary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\sometimes they write poetry, sometimes recipes$
+for ice cream‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xtake three cups of flour, a pint of cream in which an$
+egg has been boiled and a pinch of vanilla‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled. Evidently Timothy had hit upon the particular brand of$
+journalism to which Mrs. Renfrew was addicted.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\there was to have been a sort of Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Welfare Meeting in Paris next week‚M-^@M-^Tan International affair‚M-^@M-^Tand when we$
+were in Madeira she received an invitation to attend with a free return$
+ticket‚M-^@M-^Twasn‚M-^@M-^Yt that splendid?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Splendid,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy absently. ‚M-^@M-^\Naturally you thought it was an$
+excellent opportunity to go also.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And now you have arrived here you find that the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Meeting has been postponed for ten years?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you know that the meeting had been postponed?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I guessed it,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\such things have happened before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The truth is,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\nobody knows anything about this$
+meeting, and the letter which Mrs. Renfrew sent to the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Society in Paris was waiting for us when we arrived at the Carlton. It$
+had been returned‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XAddressee Unknown.‚M-^@M-^Y Mrs. Renfrew had put the Carlton$
+address inside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was ample excuse for speculation of an innocuous kind. Mrs. Renfrew$
+had been approached because it was known by this mysterious somebody$
+that she would take the girl with her, and this sinister somebody had$
+hired two thugs to shepherd her from Madeira and to put Timothy out of$
+action, should he decide to accompany the party to France. The situation$
+was distinctly interesting.$
+$
+Three days later the party crossed the Channel. Timothy had high hopes$
+of adventure, which were fated to be more than fulfilled. They stayed$
+three days in Paris and he had the time of his life. He went to the$
+races at Maisons Lafitte, and came back glowing with a sense of his$
+virtue, for he had not made a bet. He drifted in to the baccara rooms at$
+Enghien, watched tens of thousands of francs change hands, and returned$
+to Paris that night with a halo fitted by Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys own hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre really wonderful, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you are$
+allowed one final flutter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym saving that up for Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+Since his arrival in Paris he had lost the right to his name, for he was$
+taking no chances. If he went abroad at night he kept to the brilliantly$
+illuminated boulevards or the crowded caf√©s. He kept clear of the$
+crowds‚M-^@M-^Tespecially crowds which formed quickly and for no apparent$
+reason.$
+$
+He was taking no chances because he felt it was not fair upon the$
+particular genius who presided over his destinies that he should$
+squander his luck in a miraculous escape from death or disablement. Only$
+once, when dining at the Scribe, did he think he saw the familiar face$
+of Mr. Brown. With an apology he left the two ladies and made his way$
+with difficulty through the crowded restaurant, only to find that his$
+man had disappeared.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\These caf√©s have as many doors as a trick-scene,‚M-^@M-^] he grumbled when he$
+came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you see a friend of yours?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not so much a friend as one who has a financial interest in me,‚M-^@M-^]$
+replied Timothy.$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew had thawed a little under the beneficent influences of$
+Paris. She was busy sending off picture-postcards and had written to$
+Bath her first impression of the French capital to the extent of three$
+columns. She had also written a poem which began: ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, city of light$
+that shines so bright,‚M-^@M-^] and went on rhyming ‚M-^@M-^\vain‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\Seine,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\gay‚M-^@M-^]$
+with ‚M-^@M-^\play,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\joy‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\alloy,‚M-^@M-^] through twenty-three stanzas.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I rather pride myself,‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew, ‚M-^@M-^\upon that description of$
+Paris‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xthe city of light.‚M-^@M-^Y Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think it is very original, Mr.$
+Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically. ‚M-^@M-^\Parisians have called it the$
+‚M-^@M-^XVille Lumi√®re‚M-^@M-^Y for about two hundred years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys almost the same, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew. ‚M-^@M-^\How clever the$
+French are!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew did not speak French and took a more generous view of the$
+young man when she discovered that he did. It fell to Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys lot to$
+order tickets, arrange cabs, pay bills and act as unofficial courier to$
+the party. He was anxious to be gone from Paris, impatient for the big$
+game to begin. For some reason, he did not anticipate that any harm$
+would come to the girl. This struck him as strange later, but at the$
+moment all his thoughts were centred upon the match between himself and$
+this old French lady who had set herself out to separate him from Mary$
+Maxell.$
+$
+No unpleasant incident‚M-^@M-^Tthe crowded condition of the dining-car$
+excepted‚M-^@M-^Tmarred the journey to Monte Carlo. There was the inevitable$
+night spent in a stuffy sleeping-berth in a car that rocked and swayed$
+to such an extent that Timothy expected it to jump the line, as$
+thousands of other passengers have expected it to do; and they came with$
+the morning to the Valley of the Rhone, a wide, blue, white-flecked$
+stream flowing between gaunt hills, past solitary ch√¢teaux and strange$
+walled towns, which looked as if they had been kept under glass cases$
+for centuries, that the modern world should be reminded of the dangers$
+under which our forefathers lived. So to Marseilles, and a long, hot and$
+slow journey to Nice.$
+$
+To the girl it was a pilgrimage of joy. She would not have missed a$
+single moment of that ride. The blue sea, the white villas with their$
+green jalousies, the banked roses over wall and pergola and the$
+warm-scented breeze, and above all the semi-tropical sun, placed her in$
+a new world, a wonder world more beautiful than imagination had painted.$
+$
+There is something about Monte Carlo which is very satisfying. It is so$
+orderly, so clean, so white and bright, that you have the impression$
+that it is carefully dusted every morning and that the villas on the$
+hills are taken down weekly by tender hands, polished and replaced.$
+$
+There is nothing garish about Monte Carlo, for all its stucco and$
+plaster. Some of the buildings, and particularly the Casino, were$
+compared by the irreverent Timothy to the White City, but it was a$
+refined White City and the Casino itself, with its glass-roofed porch,$
+its great, solemn hanging lamps and its decorous uniformed attendants,$
+had something of the air of a National Bank.$
+$
+Timothy took a room at the H√¥tel de Paris, where the girl was staying,$
+and lost no time in seeking information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge. ‚M-^@M-^\There is a madame who bears that$
+name, I think, but she is not staying here, monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of whom should I inquire, I pray you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in the vernacular.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of the Municipal Council, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge, ‚M-^@M-^\or, if the$
+madame is a wealthy madame, of the manager of the Credit Lyonnais, who$
+will perhaps inform monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thanks many times,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He went first to the Credit Lyonnais, and found the manager extremely$
+polite but uncommunicative. It was not the practice of the bank, he$
+said, to disclose the addresses of their clients. He would not say that$
+Madame Serpilot was his client, but if she were, he could certainly not$
+give her address to any unauthorised person. From this Timothy gathered$
+that Madame Serpilot was a client. He went on to the Mairie and met with$
+better fortune. The Mairie had no respect for persons. It was there to$
+supply information and what the Mairie of Monte Carlo does not know$
+about Monaco, the cleverest detective force in the world would be$
+wasting its time trying to discover.$
+$
+Madame Serpilot lived at the Villa Condamine. The Villa Condamine was$
+not, as the name suggested, in the poorer part of Monte Carlo but in$
+that most exclusive territory, the tiny peninsula of Cap Martin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has madam been a resident long?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For one hundred and twenty-nine days,‚M-^@M-^] replied the official promptly.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame hired the villa furnished from the agent, of the Grand Duchess$
+Eleana who, alas! was destroyed in that terrible revolution.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He gave Timothy some details of the family from which the Grand Duchess$
+had sprung, the amount of her income in pre-war days, and was passing to$
+her eccentricities when Timothy took his departure. He was not$
+interested in the Grand Duchess Eleana, alive or dead.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIX$
+$
+$
+HE went to the house agent on the main street and from him procured$
+the exact position of Madame Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys residence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\An old madame?‚M-^@M-^] said the agent. ‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur, I cannot say that she is$
+old. And I cannot say that she is young.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He thought a moment, as though endeavouring to find some reason for this$
+reticence on the subject of her age, and then added:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have not seen her. Madame is a widow,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Alas! there are$
+so many in France as the result of the terrible war.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then she is young,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\They didn‚M-^@M-^Yt send old men to the$
+front.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may be young,‚M-^@M-^] replied the agent, ‚M-^@M-^\or she may be old. One does not$
+know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the assistant who had shown the lady the house and had taken$
+the documents for her to sign. The assistant was aged sixteen, and at$
+the age of sixteen most people above twenty are listed amongst the aged.$
+He was certain she was a widow and very feeble, because she walked with$
+a stick. She always wore a heavy black veil, even when she was in the$
+garden.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it not natural,‚M-^@M-^] said the house agent romantically, ‚M-^@M-^\that the madame$
+who has lost all that makes life worth living should no longer desire$
+the world to look upon her face?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It may be natural in Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not natural$
+in London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He located the house on a large plan which the obliging agent produced,$
+and went back to the hotel, firmly resolved to take the first$
+opportunity of calling on Madame Serpilot and discovering what object$
+she had in view when she arranged to endanger his young life.$
+$
+Mary was waiting for him, a little impatiently for one who had such a$
+horror of gambling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have to get tickets at the Bureau,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\and the concierge$
+says we must have special membership cards for the Cercle Priv√©e.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The tickets were easy to procure, and they passed into the great saloon$
+where, around five tables, stood silent ovals of humanity. The scene was$
+a weird one to Timothy and fascinating too. Besides this, all the other$
+gambling games in the world, all the roulette tables and baccara$
+outfits, were crude and amateurish. The eight croupiers who sat at each$
+table in their black frock coats and their black ties, solemn visaged,$
+unemotional, might have been deacons in committee. The click of rakes$
+against chips, the whirr of the twirling ball, the monotonous sing-song$
+announcement of the chief croupier‚M-^@M-^Tit was a ritual and a business at$
+one and the same time.$
+$
+It was amazing to reflect that, year in and year out, from ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock$
+in the morning until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock at night (until midnight in the Cercle$
+Priv√©e) these black-coated men sat at their tables, twirling their$
+rakes, watching without error every note or counter that fell on the$
+table, separating notes from chips with a deftness that was amazing,$
+doing this in such an atmosphere of respectability that the most rabid$
+anti-gambler watching the scene must come in time to believe that$
+roulette was a legitimate business exercise.$
+$
+Through the years this fringe of people about the table would remain,$
+though units would go out, and as units went out new units would replace$
+them, and everlastingly would sit shabby old men and women with their$
+cryptic notebooks, making their tableaux with red and black pencils,$
+religiously recording the result of every coup, staking now and again$
+their five-franc pieces, and watching them raked to the croupier with$
+stony despair or drawing with trembling hands the few poor francs which$
+fortune had sent them.$
+$
+Timothy was very silent when they passed the portals of the Cercle$
+Priv√©e, into that wonderful interior which, viewed from the entrance$
+room, had the appearance of some rich cathedral.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you think of them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mary.$
+$
+He did not answer at once.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did you think of the people?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded again. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you see$
+that quaint old woman‚M-^@M-^Ttaking a chance? I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+really didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and sighed.$
+$
+The roulette table did not attract him. He strolled off to watch the$
+players at _trente et quarante_. Here the procedure was more$
+complicated. One of the officials dealt two lines of cards, ending each$
+when the pips added to something over thirty. The top line stood for$
+black, the lower line for red, and that which was nearest to thirty won.$
+After mastering this, the process was simple; you could either back the$
+red or the black, or you could bet that the first card that was dealt$
+was identical with the colour that won, or was the reverse.$
+$
+The game interested him. It had certain features which in a way were$
+fascinating. He noticed that the croupier never spoke of the black. The$
+black might have had no existence at the _trente et quarante_ table;$
+either ‚M-^@M-^\red won‚M-^@M-^] or ‚M-^@M-^\red lost.‚M-^@M-^] He staked a louis and won twice. He$
+staked another and lost it. Then he won three coups of a louis and$
+looked around uncertainly, almost guiltily, for Mary.$
+$
+She was watching the roulette players, and Timothy took a wad of bills$
+from his pocket and counted out six milles. That was another thing he$
+was to discover: there were three classes of players‚M-^@M-^Tthose who punted$
+in one or five louis pieces, those who bet handsomely in milles (a$
+thousand-franc note is a ‚M-^@M-^\mille‚M-^@M-^] and has no other name), and those who$
+went the maximum of twelve thousand francs on each coup.$
+$
+Money had no value. He threw six thousand down to the croupier and$
+received in exchange six oblong plaques like thin cakes of blue soap. He$
+put a thousand francs on the black and lost it. He looked round$
+apprehensively for Mary, but she was still intent upon the roulette$
+players. He ventured another thousand, and lost that too. A young$
+Englishman sitting at the table looked up with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre betting against the tableau,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The table is running red$
+to-night. Look!‚M-^@M-^] He showed a little notebook ruled into divisions, and$
+long lines of dots, one under the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all these$
+are reds. The table has only swung across to black twice for any run,$
+and then it was only a run of four. If you bet against the table you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+go broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At any other place than at the tables at Monte Carlo advice of this$
+character, and intimate references to financial possibilities, would be$
+resented. But the Rooms, like the grave, level all the players, who are$
+a great family banded together in an unrecognised brotherhood for the$
+destruction of a common enemy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance against the table,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I shall go$
+broke, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman laughed.$
+$
+The four thousand francs he had left went the same way as their friends$
+and Timothy changed another six thousand and threw two on the black.$
+Then, acting on the impulse of the moment, he threw down the remaining$
+four.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned at the shocked voice and Mary was standing behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you gamble like that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He tried to smile, but produced a grimace.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, it is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is only francs, and francs aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+real money, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She turned and walked away and he followed. The Englishman, twisting$
+round in his chair, said something. Timothy thought he was asking$
+whether he should look after his money and answered ‚M-^@M-^\Certainly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl walked to one of the padded benches by the wall and sat down.$
+There was such real trouble in her face that Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys heart sank.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is my last fling and you told me I$
+could have it. After to-night I cut out everything that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt qualify$
+for the ‚M-^@M-^Xearned income‚M-^@M-^Y column of the tax-surveyor.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt the amount of money you were$
+venturing, but there was something in your face which made me feel‚M-^@M-^Twhy!$
+I just felt sick,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary!‚M-^@M-^] he said in surprise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know I‚M-^@M-^Ym being unreasonable,‚M-^@M-^] she interrupted, ‚M-^@M-^\but Timothy, I‚M-^@M-^TI$
+just don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to think of you like this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked into his dejected face and the softest light that ever shone$
+in woman‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes was in hers.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said, half in jest, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yre paying the penalty for$
+having a girl friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying the penalty for being a loafer,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily. ‚M-^@M-^\I think$
+there must be some bad blood in us. Mary, I know what I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and took one of her hands. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing the right to love you,$
+dearest.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a queer place for such a confession, and in her wildest dreams$
+the girl never imagined that the first word of love spoken to her by any$
+man would come in a gambling saloon at Monte Carlo. Above her where she$
+sat was the great canvas of the Florentine Graces; half nude reliefs on$
+the ceiling dangled glittering chains of light and over all sounded the$
+monotonous voice of the croupier:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tet couleur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The young Englishman at the table turned round with an inquiring lift of$
+his eyebrows, and Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wants to know if I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and honestly$
+Mary, I am. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going back to London when this trip‚M-^@M-^Ys over, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going to start at the bottom and work up.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to lie to you, or pretend any longer. I just love you,$
+Mary, and if you‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for me, I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good. I have been a gambler,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\a poor, low gambler, and all the time I‚M-^@M-^Yve thought I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+clever! I‚M-^@M-^Yve been going round puffed up with my own self-importance, and$
+my head‚M-^@M-^Ys been so much in the air that I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt seen just where my feet$
+were leading me,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\This sounds like the sort of thing you$
+get at the Salvation Army penitent form,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I‚M-^@M-^Ym straight and$
+sincere.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you are, Timothy, but you needn‚M-^@M-^Yt start at the bottom. I have my$
+money‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop where you are, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\Not a penny would I take$
+from you, darling.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did they ring that bell for?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+It was the second time the tinkle of sound had come from the croupier at$
+the _trente et quarante_ table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Heaven knows!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe it is to call the other$
+worshippers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the young Englishman looked round and said something.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he say?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He said seventeen,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Was that the number you backed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no numbers on that table except No. 1‚M-^@M-^Tand No. 1 is the fat$
+man with the rake‚M-^@M-^The gets it coming and going. Mary, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to ask$
+you one question: If I make good will you marry me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was silent and again the voice of the croupier came:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tcouleur gagne.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What does ‚M-^@M-^Xrouge perd‚M-^@M-^Y mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked. ‚M-^@M-^\He has said that ever so many$
+times.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means ‚M-^@M-^Xblack wins,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does black always win?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not always,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe he‚M-^@M-^Ys only saying that to lure$
+me back to the table. Mary, what do you say?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and to the scandal of the one attendant who was$
+watching them he bent forward and kissed her.$
+$
+A terrible act this, for the gold-laced and liveried footman, who came$
+with slow, majestic steps to where they sat.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\this is not done.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked up at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Chassez-vous_,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly.$
+$
+It was startling French, but it was the nearest he could get at the$
+moment to ‚M-^@M-^\chase yourself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the bell tinkled, and the young Englishman rose, thrust a small$
+packet of money into his pocket and came toward them, bearing what$
+looked to be a large book without covers. His face was a little haggard$
+and the perspiration stood upon his forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is getting on my nerves, old man. You had better play yourself,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, and he handed the book to Timothy, and Timothy looked vaguely$
+from his hands to the hot Englishman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys this?‚M-^@M-^] he croaked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A run of twenty-eight on the black,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+phenomenal! You wanted me to go on, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you? I asked you whether I$
+should play your thousand francs. The bank bust four times‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+hear them ring for more money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded. He had no words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, your six went to twelve and I left the maximum run,‚M-^@M-^] the$
+Englishman said. ‚M-^@M-^\I asked you if that was right and you nodded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I nodded,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy mechanically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve won twenty-seven and a half maximums.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at the money in his hand, looked up at the ceiling and$
+gulped something down.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] he gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\I am obliged to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was inadequate, but it was all that he could say.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\I won a lot of money myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a great hand at arithmetic,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\will you tell me$
+how many pounds twenty-seven and a half maximums make?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a remarkable situation. Somebody should have laughed, but they$
+were all too serious, the girl as serious as Timothy, and the young$
+Englishman scrawling calculations on a loose page of his notebook.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thirty-five francs to a pound,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\makes ¬£340 a coup.$
+Twenty-seven and a half is about‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and he gripped the other‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and wrung it.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you, fairy godmother‚M-^@M-^TI don‚M-^@M-^Yt know your other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They stood together watching his lanky figure, as he, wholly unconscious$
+of the providential part he had played, moved down to the roulette$
+table, eyeing the game with the air of superiority which every player of$
+_trente et quarante_ has for a game with a paltry maximum of six$
+thousand francs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] whispered the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it wonderful?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He put the money into his pocket and it bulged untidily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do with it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Give it to the poor,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, taking her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the poor?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was wondering whether his fortune had driven him mad.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The poor,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly, ‚M-^@M-^\money won by gambling‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense,‚M-^@M-^] she broke in, ‚M-^@M-^\to what poor are you giving it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To poor Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] said he. ‚M-^@M-^\Let us dash madly to the bar and drink$
+orangeade.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XX$
+$
+$
+THE band was playing one of de Courville‚M-^@M-^Ys new revue tunes, and the$
+Caf√© de Paris was crowded out. There had been a big influx of visitors$
+from Nice, and Monte Carlo presented an appearance comparable with the$
+height of the season. Mrs. Renfrew had motored up to La Turbie, and a$
+bank of cloud having descended upon the mountain made the road$
+dangerous. (Those who have journeyed from the Corniche to Monte Carlo by$
+night will appreciate just how dangerous is that road.) She had,$
+therefore, elected to spend the night at the hotel on the top of the$
+hill.$
+$
+This information she had telephoned to the girl on the night following$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys great win, and had added that she could see ‚M-^@M-^\the twinkling$
+lights of Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^] and that ‚M-^@M-^\the misty spaces of ocean filled her$
+with strange unrest,‚M-^@M-^] which observation had been repeated to the$
+unsympathetic Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It must be awful to have a mind like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and then, ‚M-^@M-^\Mary,$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve been a long time waiting to exchange confidences about cousins.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no confidences to give you about Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary with a$
+smile, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have been on the point of telling me about your cousin$
+so often that I feel a little curious.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The story he had to tell was not a nice one. It meant opening old wounds$
+and reviving sad memories, but it had to be done. She was not so shocked$
+as he had expected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have not told me anything new,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\You see, all$
+along I have known that the ‚M-^@M-^XA.C.‚M-^@M-^Y in your name stood for ‚M-^@M-^XAlfred$
+Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^Y and once uncle told me that he had known a relative of$
+yours, and I guessed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly she demanded:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think Cartwright is in Europe?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am certain. That is, if Morocco is in Europe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have had$
+it in the back of my mind ever since the crime was committed that that$
+is the place he would make for. You see, in the few minutes I had with$
+him he told me, perhaps not the whole of the story, but at any rate his$
+version. He knows Morocco and has been there before. He spoke about a$
+Moorish chief named El Mograb, who wanted him to stay with the tribe,$
+and he told me he was sorry he had not followed the Moor‚M-^@M-^Ys advice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell the police that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did not tell the police very much about that visit. Cartwright$
+revived his accusations against Sir John. It meant digging up these$
+charges, and that is what I did not wish to do, for‚M-^@M-^Tfor‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For my sake?‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys about the size of it,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+A little stream of diners were leaving the restaurant, moving slowly$
+down the narrow aisle between the tables, and Timothy stopped talking as$
+they passed and eyed them with a bored interest usual to the$
+circumstances.$
+$
+It was after the interruption had ended, and the last of the little$
+stream had departed, that he saw the card on the table. It was near his$
+place and it had not been there before. He picked it up and on the$
+uppermost side was written: ‚M-^@M-^\Do not let your friend see this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began, and turned the card over.$
+$
+It was not written but printed in capital letters:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM ME BY THE TWENTY-NINTH, I BEG OF YOU$
+    THAT YOU WILL GO TO TANGIER AND ENQUIRE AT THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL$
+    FOR A MAN CALLED RAHBAT‚M-^@M-^TA MOOR, WHO WILL LEAD YOU TO ME. I BEG$
+    YOU FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO COME. DID YOU GET THE$
+    MONEY?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy laid the card down and stared at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and reached out her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Tit is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense, Timothy. What is it? Let me see it, please.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Without a word he handed the card to the girl, who read it through in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is that from?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, ‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Obviously,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the reference to the money and the appeal to our$
+relationship‚M-^@M-^Tbut how did it get there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the head waiter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who were those people who went out just now?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They are very well known,‚M-^@M-^] explained the head waiter. ‚M-^@M-^\There was a$
+monsieur, a London theatrical manager, and a madame who was his wife.$
+There was another monsieur, an American writer, and an English monsieur$
+who was in the employment as secretary to a madame who lives at Cap$
+Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, that is the name. She is a widow, _h√©las_! but immensely rich!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy put the card into his pocket. He had said nothing to the girl$
+about Madame Serpilot since they had left London, and for the first time$
+he had some misgivings as to her safety. Yet in truth that sixth sense$
+of his, which had hitherto worked so to his advantage, offered him no$
+warning that the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys happiness was threatened. He was sure that$
+whatever danger the situation held was danger to him personally. He had$
+not seen the English monsieur who was secretary to Madame Serpilot, but$
+then his back had been toward the far end of the room from whence the$
+man came and he had presented no other view than the back of his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a message from Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am going to get to$
+the bottom of this story if I stay in Monte Carlo for the rest of my$
+life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw Mary back to her hotel, went to his room and changed, and just as$
+the Casino was disgorging its tired clients, he walked through the$
+palm-shaded avenue that led to the main road and began his tramp to Cap$
+Martin. To discover a house in this area by daylight, with the aid of a$
+plan, might have been a simple matter‚M-^@M-^Tby night it presented almost$
+insuperable difficulties.$
+$
+Cap Martin is a promontory of hill and pine and wild flower. Its roads$
+run at the will of its wealthy residents, and there are lanes and paths$
+and broad roads which are not really broad roads at all, but the private$
+entrances to the wonderful villas in which the district abounds, and the$
+grey light was in the eastern sky when Timothy finally located the Villa$
+Condamine.$
+$
+It stood on the edge of the sea, surrounded on the land side by a high$
+wall, though if its owner sought seclusion the woods which surrounded$
+the villa were sufficient.$
+$
+Timothy worked round a little bay until he commanded a view of the place$
+from the sea. A zig-zag path led down from the house to the seashore,$
+terminating in a little concrete quay. Presently he heard the sound of$
+footsteps and a Monogasque workman, in blue overalls, came slouching$
+along the shore path, pipe in mouth.$
+$
+He bade the young man a cheery good morning and stopped, in the friendly$
+way of the Monogasques, to talk. He was a gardener on his way to the$
+villa. He could be on his way to nowhere else, for the rough path on$
+which Timothy stood led straight to a door in the high wall. It was a$
+good job, but he wished he lived nearer. But then, none of madame‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+servants slept in the house, and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! _voil√†!_ It is the Moor!‚M-^@M-^] and he pointed out to sea.$
+$
+A tiny steam yacht was coming slowly to land‚M-^@M-^TTimothy had seen its$
+lights for an hour‚M-^@M-^Tand was steaming now to its anchorage, leaving the$
+line of its wake on the smooth surface of the water.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Moor!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quickly, and then carelessly, ‚M-^@M-^\Has any Moor a$
+villa here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is a great Moor who sometimes$
+comes here from Morocco. A long journey, monsieur. It is five days‚M-^@M-^Y$
+voyage from the Moorish coast‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does he come to the Villa Condamine?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\He is a friend of the madame, and twice has he$
+been there in three months.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was a little splash of water under the bow of the yacht, when the$
+anchor was dropped, and presently a boat drew away and in the stern$
+sheets was a figure muffled in a white jellab.$
+$
+Timothy looked after the retreating figure of the gardener, who was$
+leisurely pursuing his way, and, turning, followed him. It was unlikely$
+that the mysterious madame would allow a humble workman to have the key$
+of the garden gate, yet to his surprise this was the case. The man$
+opened the gate and waited, looking round as if he expected somebody.$
+Timothy guessed that there were two or more workmen and that this$
+particular man had the key and admitted the lot. In this surmise he$
+proved to be right. Presently yet another blue-bloused gardener$
+appeared, and the two stood together waiting for a third. He made no$
+appearance, and the two men passed through the door and pulled it close$
+behind them.$
+$
+Timothy quickened his pace. As he had thought, the door was left ajar$
+for the third man. He pushed it open gently, but saw nothing but the end$
+of a twisting path, which disappeared between high hedges of lilac.$
+$
+If ever there was a time to take a chance it was now; and he was through$
+the gate, gingerly treading the path, before he realised what he had$
+done. He heard voices and moved with caution. Then, after about five$
+minutes, he heard the garden gate behind him bang. The third workman had$
+arrived and the exit was closed. He made his way through the pines which$
+served to screen the house from observation. There was nobody in sight,$
+and the voices had died away. He could walk more boldly now and came at$
+last to the edge of the wood in full view of the villa. Between him and$
+the house was about fifty yards of clear space. He took a chance and$
+crossed it, his objective being a ground-floor window which was open.$
+$
+The entrance was not so easily effected as he had expected. The sill of$
+the window was just above the level of his head, and offered no grip to$
+his hands. He made a tour of reconnaissance, but failed to find any$
+other entrance. Behind the sill, he thought, must be a window frame, and$
+stepping back two paces he made a leap and gripped the frame. Quickly he$
+pulled himself up and dropped into the room.$
+$
+He was conscious of a sweet, fragrant perfume the moment his head became$
+level with the window, and now he saw the explanation. The bare floor$
+was covered three inches thick with rose petals. Evidently the owner$
+made her own perfumery, and this hobby explained the open window. There$
+was no furniture in the room, which was apparently given up to the$
+purpose of drying the petals. The door was unfastened, and he passed$
+into a stone corridor. The structure of the house puzzled him. He did$
+not expect to find himself in the basement; then he remembered that the$
+villa was built on sloping ground, and that the main entrance must be on$
+a higher floor.$
+$
+A flight of stone steps led to the upper level, and he went up$
+cautiously, a step at a time, and found his exit barred by a door which$
+was fastened on the other side with padlock and staple. It was a$
+primitive method of locking up a cellar, and Timothy, remembering that$
+he had passed a recess filled with garden tools, went back to find the$
+means to remove this obstruction. A long chisel prised the staples from$
+the door with ridiculous ease.$
+$
+He heard voices speaking in low, guarded tones and moved along the$
+carpeted hall on tiptoe. He listened at the door of the room from which$
+the voices proceeded, and was in two minds as to what his next step$
+should be. The door was one of two let in the same wall. He stopped and$
+brought his ear to the keyhole of the second and there was no sound.$
+Turning the handle, he looked in.$
+$
+As he expected, it was separated from the other room by a pair of$
+folding doors which were closed. The voices were more distinct but still$
+indistinguishable. He was now in a small drawing-room, well but not$
+luxuriously furnished. Tall French windows led to a loggia, and, what$
+was more important, on either side of these hung long velvet curtains,$
+which might serve, in case of necessity, as a place of concealment.$
+$
+He heard the door of the next room open, and the voices proceeded along$
+the passage. Then the handle of his own door turned. He had just time to$
+slip behind the curtains before somebody entered. It was a woman, and at$
+the sound of her voice he nearly jumped. She was speaking to somebody in$
+the passage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He has gone to his room,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Have your breakfast. He will want$
+you to go into Monte Carlo this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\By daylight?‚M-^@M-^] said the person to whom she spoke, and again Timothy$
+recognised the voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He would not know you with those spectacles. Besides, you had a$
+moustache when you saw him before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man in the passage mumbled something, and Timothy heard the door of$
+the room close. There was a desk, he had noticed, against the blank wall$
+of the room, and it was to this she made her way. He heard the$
+scratching of her pen on paper, then he walked from his place of$
+concealment. Her back was to him and she did not hear him until his$
+shadow fell across the table. Then, with a little cry, she leapt up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good morning, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XXI$
+$
+$
+SADIE MAXELL was as white as the paper on which she had been writing.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you get in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy did not answer. He stepped round so that he was between the$
+woman and the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where is Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to know of him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lower your voice, if you please,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What is$
+Cartwright to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She licked her dry lips before she spoke. Then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I married Cartwright or Benson in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tyears ago,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+Timothy took a step back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You married Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said incredulously. ‚M-^@M-^\That explains why you$
+came away?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was looking at him steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it wanted any explanation‚M-^@M-^Tyes,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to$
+do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going after the man you have upstairs, the fake Moor, who came into$
+this house half an hour ago, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to hand him to justice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before he knew what had happened, she gripped him by his coat with both$
+hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are not going to do anything of the kind, Mr. ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said between her teeth, and her voice trembled with$
+passion. ‚M-^@M-^\I hated him once, but that was before I knew him. I would$
+sooner see you dead as the other man died than that you should bring him$
+more trouble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let me go,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, trying to press loose her hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll leave this house and forget that you were ever here. Oh, you$
+fool, you fool!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had wrenched himself clear of her and flung her backward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have a few words to say to your friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I think you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better stay here whilst I‚M-^@M-^Ym saying them. I hate having family quarrels$
+in public, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had not heard the door open behind him and it was the ‚M-^@M-^\swish‚M-^@M-^] of the$
+loaded cane which warned him. It did not strike him fair on the head, as$
+was intended, but caught him a glancing blow and he fell on his knees,$
+turning his face to his attacker. He knew it was Brown even before the$
+blow fell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I settle him?‚M-^@M-^] said a voice as the stick went up again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no!‚M-^@M-^] cried the woman, ‚M-^@M-^\for God‚M-^@M-^Ys sake, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was at that moment that Timothy low-tackled his assailant. Brown$
+tried to strike, but he was too late and went crashing to the floor, his$
+head against the wall. He made one effort to rise, and then with a groan$
+collapsed.$
+$
+Timothy rose, shaking himself and rubbing his bruised shoulder. Without$
+a word, and with only a look at the woman, he made for the door and$
+banged it in her face. His head was swimming as he made his way up the$
+stairs, swaying at every step. From the broad landing at the top led$
+three doors, only one of which was closed. He turned the handle and went$
+in.$
+$
+A man was standing by the window, which overlooked the calm expanse of$
+ocean, glittering in the light of the rising sun. From shoulder to heel$
+he was clad in a long white mantle and a dark blue turban encircled his$
+head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\you and I will settle accounts.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man had not moved at the sound of the voice, but when Timothy had$
+finished he turned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My God!‚M-^@M-^] cried Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\TIMOTHY,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary, ‚M-^@M-^\I was just thinking about that beautiful house$
+you took me to see at Cap Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Were you, dear?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy without any show of interest.$
+$
+They were on the cross-Channel boat and Boulogne was astern.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you know, I had a feeling that you had taken$
+me there to show me to somebody, some friend of yours perhaps. All the$
+time I was walking about the garden I had a sense of being watched. It$
+is not an uncomfortable sensation, but just that overlooked feeling one$
+has sometimes. I love Monte Carlo. Do you think we shall go back there$
+after‚M-^@M-^Tafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is likely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl rose and went forward along the deck to get a view of a passing$
+destroyer. Timothy took a letter from his pocket and read it for about$
+the twentieth time. It was undated and began:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MY DEAR ANDERSON,‚M-^@M-^TI cannot tell you how grateful I am to you$
+    for your kindness and for the big, generous sympathy you have$
+    shown me. Especially am I glad that you brought Mary so that I$
+    could see her again, for I just hungered for a sight of the$
+    child. Won‚M-^@M-^Yt you please forgive Sadie? She acted without my$
+    knowledge but in my interests, as she thought, in trying to keep$
+    you away from Monte Carlo after she had planned to bring the$
+    girl so that I could see her.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I killed Cartwright, but I shot him in self-defence. His$
+    body lies at the bottom of a disused well in the garden of my$
+    house. It is perfectly true that I had been associated in$
+    business with him and that I was in his Moorish syndicate and$
+    heavily involved. I was so very deeply involved at one time, and$
+    so near to ruin that, deceived by some statement which had been$
+    made to Sadie‚M-^@M-^Ys fortune, I made her acquaintance and married$
+    her. During the past year I have never ceased to thank God that$
+    I did so, for she had been the most loyal companion and friend$
+    that a man could desire.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\It was I who fired the shot through my own window. I$
+    contemplated flight from Cartwright, and was manufacturing$
+    evidence against him in advance‚M-^@M-^TGod forgive me. Sadie guessed,$
+    and when she watched me drawing from the well the bag containing$
+    proof that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys charge was not wholly false, she knew$
+    the end was near.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I am perfectly happy, and spend most of my time developing my$
+    property in Morocco, under the protection of El Mograb, an old$
+    Moorish friend of mine, and the supreme protection of the$
+    Sultan, who, as the Pretender, received considerable help from$
+    me. I am six months of the year with Sadie, for Sadie either$
+    lives on the Riviera or at Cadiz and is easily reachable in my$
+    hired yacht.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I think it best for all concerned, and especially for our dear$
+    Mary, that I remain as dead. Some day the whole story may be$
+    told, but no useful purpose would be served by publishing it$
+    to-day. The card with the message was intended for her, but I am$
+    glad that it fell into your hands. As you guessed, it was I who$
+    flung Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys money into your room‚M-^@M-^TI dared not post it to her$
+    for fear I was betrayed by my writing, and I knew that you were$
+    safe. God bless you both and bring you happiness and prosperity,$
+    to which I hope this property of mine will one day contribute.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy folded the letter and was putting it in his pocket, then changed$
+his mind and took it out. He read it again, then tore it into pieces and$
+flung it over the side of the ship.$
+$
+Then he too went forward to the wife he had married in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tmuch$
+against the wishes of a scandalised Mrs. Renfrew‚M-^@M-^Twho nevertheless$
+termed it ‚M-^@M-^\a pretty romance‚M-^@M-^] in the article she wrote for the _Bath$
+County Herald_.$

+$
+$
+    A Wonder for$
+    Wise Men$
+    By$
+    Wallace B. Nichols$
+$
+    THOUGH an historical romance, this book is much more than$
+    that, for its theme touches present-day ideas in a remarkable$
+    manner, especially as concerns the hideous uselessness of war.$
+    It is set in the reign of Henry VII and deals with the aftermath$
+    of the Wars of the Roses. The principal character becomes one of$
+    the King‚M-^@M-^Ys most trusted instruments in the founding of modern$
+    England, and the story marches to an emotional and uplifting$
+    close. This is an historical novel where the characters are not$
+    puppets of impossible romance, but living human beings as real$
+    as the people about us every day.$

+$
+    SECRET MARKET$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This is a first novel by one of our younger poets, and it is a$
+    novel which equally plainly shows him to be an artist. The plot$
+    is cleverly developed, and the story ends at once dramatically$
+    and artistically.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The Glasgow Herald._$
+$
+    BRITTLE GLORY$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Wallace B. Nichols deserves congratulation. He has demonstrated$
+    a capacity for expression, in terms of strength, beauty and$
+    sincerity, through two mediums. It is an uncommon book with an$
+    outstanding quality: it never ceases to be readable.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The$
+    Observer._$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Nichols has all the gifts of a great novelist: an unerring sense$

+    Mr. Fortune$
+    Explains$
+    By$
+    H. C. Bailey$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MR. FORTUNE‚M-^@M-^] has long since established himself as one of the$
+    brightest stars in the galaxy of modern crime detectives. He$
+    works on the friendliest terms with Scotland Yard, but his$
+    methods‚M-^@M-^Tand incidentally his manners‚M-^@M-^Tare peculiarly his own.$
+    Here we have a series of the most widely divergent mysteries$
+    successively solved by a bland, imperturbable middle-aged$
+    gentleman whose sole concern in life appears to be that he shall$
+    not miss his lunch or any other comfort that is due to him. No$
+    one who has read other ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Fortune‚M-^@M-^] volumes will on any account$
+    miss this, while those who have yet to make the dear man‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+    acquaintance are to be envied for the joy that awaits them.$

+              Mr. Fortune Speaking   My Lady of Orange, etc.$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   Mr. H. C. Bailey is not only a master in the realm of historic$
+    romance, but in that of the mystery story as well: in fact, he is$
+    easily one of the best and most logical of all the many writers of$
+    the detective story to-day.$

+    The Subway$
+    Mystery$
+    By$
+    Ben Bolt$
+$
+    ONE would think it impossible for anybody to walk down into$
+    the crowded new Piccadilly Circus Tube Station and there be$
+    swiftly murdered without immediate discovery of the assassin.$
+    But from the slenderest of clues the whole failure of a great$
+    vengeance is discovered, and Mr. Ben Bolt has provided in his$
+    new story a series of situations and adventures that would keep$
+    the sleepiest reader agog for the end.$

+$
+    ADMIRERS of ‚M-^@M-^\Wee Macgreegor‚M-^@M-^] and kindred works will be$
+    interested to see what the talented author makes of a more$
+    ambitious theme. Subtle characterization is here combined with$
+    the thrills of an Armada treasure hunt, complicated by the$
+    misunderstandings and perplexities of three widely divergent$
+    love affairs. The scenes are laid partly in Spain, partly in the$
+    Western Isles, and what with bloodstained daggers, mysterious$
+    scraps of parchment, buried caskets, plotting priests,$
+    mysterious garden-haunting strangers, and speedy motor-boats,$
+    the reader is kept constantly guessing.$

+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of$

+computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It$
+exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations$

+goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will$

+Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure$
+and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future$
+generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see$

+Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg$
+Literary Archive Foundation$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide$
+spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of$
+increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be$
+freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest$
+array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations$
+($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt$
+status with the IRS.$
+$
+The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating$
+charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United$
+States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a$
+considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up$
+with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations$
+where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND$
+DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular$
+state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we$
+have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition$
+against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who$
+approach us with offers to donate.$
+$
+International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make$
+any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from$
+outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.$
+$
+Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation$
+methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other$
+ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To$
+donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.$
+$
+Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project$
+Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be$
+freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and$
+distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of$
+volunteer support.$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed$
+editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in$
+the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not$
+necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper$
+edition.$
+$
+Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search$
+facility: www.gutenberg.org$
+$
+This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,$
+including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to$
+subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.$

+                               CHAPTER I$
+$
+$
+IT was two hours after the muezzin had called to evening prayer, and$
+night had canopied Tangier with a million stars. In the little Sok, the$
+bread-sellers sat cross-legged behind their wares, their candles burning$
+steadily, for there was not so much as the whisper of a wind blowing.$
+The monotonous strumming of a guitar from a Moorish caf√©, the agonised$
+_barlak!_ of a belated donkey-driver bringing his charge down the steep$
+streets which lead to the big bazaar, the shuffle of bare feet on$
+Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys cobbles, and the distant hush-hush of the rollers breaking$
+upon the amber shore‚M-^@M-^Tthese were the only sounds which the night held.$
+$
+John Maxell sat outside the Continental Caf√©, in the condition of bodily$
+content which a good dinner induces. Mental content should have$
+accompanied such a condition, but even the memory of a perfect dinner$
+could not wholly obliterate a certain uneasiness of mind. He had been$
+uneasy when he came to Tangier, and his journey through France and Spain$
+had been accompanied by certain apprehensions and doubts which$
+Cartwright had by no means dispelled.$
+$
+Rather, by his jovial evasions, his cheery optimism, and at times his$
+little irritable outbreaks of temper, he had given the eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Counsel further cause for disquiet.$
+$
+Cartwright sat at the other side of the table, and was unusually quiet.$
+This was a circumstance which was by no means displeasing to Maxell, for$
+the night was not conducive to talk. There are in Northern Africa many$
+nights like this, when one wishes to sit in dead silence and let thought$
+take its own course, unchecked and untrammelled. In Morocco such nights$
+are common and, anyway, Maxell had always found it difficult to discuss$
+business matters after dinner.$
+$
+Cartwright had no temperament and his quiet was due to other causes. It$
+was he who broke the silence, knocking out his pipe on the iron-topped$
+table with a clang which jarred his more sensitive companion to the very$
+spine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd stake my life and my soul on there being a reef,‚M-^@M-^] he said with a$
+suddenness which was almost as jarring. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, you‚M-^@M-^Yve seen the outcrop$
+for yourself, and isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it exactly the same formation as you see on the$
+Rand?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell nodded.$
+$
+Though a common-law man, he had been associated in mining cases and had$
+made a very careful study of the whole problem of gold extraction.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It looks right enough to me,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but as against that we have the$
+fact that some clever engineers have spent a great deal of time and$
+money trying to locate the reef. That there is gold in Morocco everybody$
+knows, and I should say, Cartwright, that you are right. But where is$
+the reef? It would cost a fortune to bore, even though we had the other$
+borings to guide us.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other made an impatient noise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if the reef were all mapped out it would be a simple matter,$
+but then we shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt get on to it, as we are to-day, at the cost of a$
+few thousands. Hang it all, Maxell, we‚M-^@M-^Yve got to take a certain amount$
+of risk! I know it‚M-^@M-^Ys a gamble quite as well as you. There‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+arguing that point with me. But other things are gambles too. Law was a$
+gamble to you for many years, and a bigger gamble after you took silk.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was a sore point with Maxell, as the other knew. A prosperous$
+junior, he had been called within the Bar, and taken upon himself the$
+function and style of King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsellor in the hope that his prosperity$
+would still further be expanded. And, like so many other men, he had$
+discovered that the successful junior is not necessarily the successful$
+K.C.$
+$
+Fortunately for him, he had long before contested and won a seat in$
+Parliament, and his service to the Government of the day had to some$
+extent ensured his future. But, financially, he had suffered$
+considerably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\silk isn‚M-^@M-^Yt any great catch to a man, I agree; and it was$
+certainly a gamble, and a losing gamble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Which reminds me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there was a talk, before I left$
+London, that you would be given Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is extremely unlikely,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Anyway, if they make me$
+Solicitor-General, that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt carry Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It carries a lot of money,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright after a pause for a moment,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and it‚M-^@M-^Ys money that counts just now, Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the lawyer nodded.$
+$
+He might have added that, but for the need for money, he would long$
+since have dropped his association with Alfred Cartwright, though$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood very high in certain circles of the City of$
+London. They had been at school together, though in that period there$
+had been no very great friendship between them. And Cartwright was$
+marked out for success from the beginning. He inherited a considerable$
+business when his father died, and he enlarged and improved upon it. He$
+had taken up a hundred and one outside interests, and had made most of$
+them pay. A few of them did not pay, and it was whispered that the$
+losses upon his failures took a considerable slice of the balance that$
+accrued from his successes.$
+$
+They had met again when Maxell was a junior and Cartwright the defendant$
+in a case which, had he lost, would have made him some thirty thousand$
+pounds the poorer. When Maxell thought back upon that event, he had to$
+confess that it was not a pleasant case, being one in which Cartwright$
+had been charged with something which was tantamount to$
+misrepresentation; and, although he had won, and won brilliantly, he had$
+never felt any great pride in his achievement.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said (the pauses were frequent and long), ‚M-^@M-^\I should hardly$
+imagine that the Prime Minister loves me to that extent. In Parliament$
+you have to be an uncomfortable quantity to be really successful. You$
+must be strong enough to have a national following, and sufficiently$
+independent to keep the Whips guessing. I am known as a safe man, and I$
+hold a safe seat, which I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose if I tried. That doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt make$
+for promotion. Of course, I could have had an Under-Secretaryship for$
+the asking, and that means a couple of thousand a year, but it also$
+means that you last out the life of the administration in a subordinate$
+capacity, and that, by the time you have made good, your party is in the$
+cold shade of opposition, and there are no jobs going.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head, and returned immediately to the question of the$
+missing reef, as though he wished to take the subject from his own$
+personal affairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You say that it would cost us a lot of money if the reef was proved,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it costing us a lot now?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is. As a matter of fact,‚M-^@M-^] he confessed, ‚M-^@M-^\the actual reef is$
+costing nothing, or next to nothing, because El Mograb is helping me. In$
+our own business‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, in the Syndicate‚M-^@M-^Tour expenses are$
+more or less small; but I am doing a little independent buying, and that$
+has meant the spending of money. I am taking up all the ground to the$
+south of the Angera‚M-^@M-^Ta pretty expensive business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is rather worrying me, you know, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\your$
+scheme is ever so much too ambitious. I was figuring it out this$
+afternoon as I was sitting in my room, and I came to the conclusion$
+that, if the scheme as you outlined it to me yesterday went through, it$
+would mean your finding two millions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Three,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the other cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\but think what it means,$
+Maxell! Supposing it went through. Supposing we struck a reef, and the$
+reef continued, as I believe it will, through the country I am taking$
+up! Why, it may mean a hundred millions to me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other sighed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have reached the point where I think a hundred thousand is an$
+enormous sum,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\However, you know your own business best,$
+Cartwright. But I want to be satisfied in the matter in which we are$
+associated together, that my liability does not exceed my power to pay.$
+And there is another matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright guessed the ‚M-^@M-^\other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was looking over your titles this afternoon,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\and I see$
+no reference to the old Spanish working. I remember that you told me a$
+Spaniard had taken up a considerable stretch of country and had$
+exhausted his capital trying to prove the reef‚M-^@M-^TSe√±or Brigot, wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+that his name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded curtly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A drunkard‚M-^@M-^Tand a bad lot,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\His moral character doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt count so far as the details go; what does$
+matter is that if your theory is correct, the reef must run through his$
+property. What are you going to do about that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Buy him out,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+He rose abruptly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym walking up to the Sok,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Come along?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They tramped up the long, steep hill-street together, and they did not$
+speak till they had passed through the ancient gate into the unrelieved$
+gloom which lies outside the city.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand you, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tyou take an old man‚M-^@M-^Ys view of things,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said Cartwright irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre comparatively young, you‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+good-looker. Why the devil don‚M-^@M-^Yt you marry, and marry money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you ever tried to marry money?‚M-^@M-^] he asked dryly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said the other after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\but I should think it is pretty$
+simple.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try it,‚M-^@M-^] said the laconic Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\It is simple in books, but in real$
+life it is next to impossible. I go about a great deal in society of all$
+kinds, and I can tell you that I have never yet met an eligible spinster$
+with money‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, large money. I agree with you,‚M-^@M-^] he went on$
+after a while, ‚M-^@M-^\a man like myself should marry. And he should marry$
+well. I could give a woman a good position, but she‚M-^@M-^Ys got to be the$
+right kind of woman. There are some times when I‚M-^@M-^Ym just frantic about my$
+position. I am getting older‚M-^@M-^TI am forty-seven next birthday‚M-^@M-^Tand every$
+day that slips past is a day lost. I ought to be married, but I can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+afford a wife. It is a blackguardly thing to talk about money in$
+connection with marriage and yet somehow I can think of nothing$
+else‚M-^@M-^Twhenever the thought arises in my mind I see an imaginary beauty$
+sitting on a big bag of gold!‚M-^@M-^] He chuckled to himself. ‚M-^@M-^\Let‚M-^@M-^Ys go back,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the big Sok always gives me the creeps.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Something lumbered past him in the darkness, some big, overpowering$
+beast with an unpleasant smell, and a guttural voice cried in Arabic:$
+‚M-^@M-^\Beware!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Camels!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright briefly. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre bringing in the stuff for$
+the morning market. The night‚M-^@M-^Ys young yet, Maxell. Let us go up to the$
+theatre.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt even know the theatre was open.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is called theatre by courtesy,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\the$
+inhabitants refer to it as the circus. It‚M-^@M-^Ys a big wooden place on the$
+sea edge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know it, I know it,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\What is being played? The only$
+people I have ever seen there have been Spanish artistes‚M-^@M-^Tand pretty bad$
+artistes, too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, there‚M-^@M-^Ys a treat for you. It is an English company, or rather, a$
+variety company with a number of English turns,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\We$
+might do worse‚M-^@M-^Tat least, I might,‚M-^@M-^] he added ominously.$
+$
+When they reached the theatre they found it sparsely filled. Cartwright$
+took one of the open boxes, and his companion settled himself into a$
+corner to smoke. The turns were of the kind which are usually to be met$
+with on the Levant; a tawdrily attired lady sang a humorous song in$
+Spanish, the humour being frankly indecent. There were a juggler and a$
+man with performing dogs, and then ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^] was announced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, turning to the programme.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may even be Irish,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell dryly.$
+$
+The wheezy little orchestra played a few bars and the girl came on. She$
+was pretty‚M-^@M-^Tthere was no doubt about that‚M-^@M-^Tand of a prettiness which$
+satisfied both men. She was also British or American, for the song she$
+sang was in a French with which both men were familiar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is horrible to see an English girl in a place like this and in such$
+company,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder where she‚M-^@M-^Ys staying,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, half to himself, and a$
+contemptuous little smile curled Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going to rescue her from her infamous surroundings?‚M-^@M-^] he asked,$
+and Cartwright snapped round on him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wish to heaven you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic, Maxell. That‚M-^@M-^Ys twice this$
+evening‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, snicking off the ash of his cigar. ‚M-^@M-^\I am in a$
+cynical mood to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He raised his hands to applaud the girl as she bowed herself from the$
+stage, and glanced round the house. Three boxes away was a small party$
+of men, whom he judged were the sons of prosperous members of the$
+Spanish colony. Their fingers flashed with diamonds, their cigarettes$
+burnt from jewelled holders. Cartwright followed the direction of the$
+other‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys made a hit, that Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\These fellows will be$
+tumbling over one another to present her with verbal bouquets. I wonder$
+where she lives!‚M-^@M-^] he said again.$
+$
+Presently the young men rose in a body and left the box, and Cartwright$
+grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you mind hanging on here whilst I go outside?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a bit,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\Where are you off to? To find out where$
+she lives?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you go again,‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I think Tangier makes you$
+liverish.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When he had got to the promenade, the men had disappeared, but a$
+question directed to the head attendant revealed, as he had expected,$
+the objective of the little party at the stage door.$
+$
+The stage door was reached from the outside of the theatre and involved$
+a journey over rubble and brick heaps. Presently he came to an open$
+doorway, where sat a solitary half-caste smoking a pipe and reading an$
+old _Heraldo_.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, _hombre_,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in Spanish, ‚M-^@M-^\have you seen my three$
+friends come in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] nodded the man; ‚M-^@M-^\they have just entered.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He indicated the direction, which lay through a dark and smelly passage.$
+$
+Cartwright walked along this stuffy hallway, and, turning the corner,$
+came upon an interesting group gathered about a closed door, against$
+which one, and the least sober, of the party was hammering. Near by$
+stood a small, stout man in soiled evening dress, grinning his approval,$
+and it was clear that the visitors were at once known and welcome.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open the door, my dream of joy,‚M-^@M-^] hiccupped the young man, hammering at$
+the panel. ‚M-^@M-^\We have come to bring you homage and adoration‚M-^@M-^Ttell her to$
+open the door, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he addressed the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, and$
+the small man minced forward and spoke in English.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is all right, my dear. Some friends of mine wish to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A voice inside, which Cartwright recognised, answered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not see them. Tell them to go away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You hear?‚M-^@M-^] said the manager, shrugging his shoulders. ‚M-^@M-^\She will not see$
+you. Now go back to your seats and let me persuade her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or!‚M-^@M-^] He raised his eyebrows to the unexpected apparition of$
+Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you doing here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is forbidden to enter the theatre through the saloon of artistes,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the small man pompously. ‚M-^@M-^\If Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your friend, you must$
+wait for her until the performance is over.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright took no notice. He was a tall man of athletic build and$
+shouldering his way past the others with no difficulty, he tapped on the$
+panel.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\here is an English visitor wants to see you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English?‚M-^@M-^] said the voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Come in for the love of Mike!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The door was opened, and a girl with a silk kimono pulled over her stage$
+dress, offered him a smiling welcome. The young Spaniard who had been$
+hammering on the panel of the door would have followed, but Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+arm barred him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want this fellow?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do I want him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady bitterly, ‚M-^@M-^\do I want the scarlet$
+fever or measles? You bet I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want him. He‚M-^@M-^Ys been pestering me ever$
+since I‚M-^@M-^Yve been here.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you hear what the lady says?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, speaking in Spanish.$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does not desire your acquaintance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My father owns this theatre,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man loudly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then he‚M-^@M-^Ys got a rotten property,‚M-^@M-^] replied the calm Cartwright.$
+$
+The Spaniard turned in a rage to his soiled satellite.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You will put this man out at once, Jose, or there will be trouble for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little man shrugged his helplessness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said in English, ‚M-^@M-^\you see my unhappy position. The se√±or is$
+the son of my proprietor and it will be bad for me if you stay. I ask$
+you as a friend and caballero to go at once and spare me misfortune.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright looked at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Must you go on again in this infernal place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, laughter and admiration in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens if you chuck this infernal job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym fired,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve a ten weeks‚M-^@M-^Y contract with these$
+people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you get?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two hundred and fifty pesetas a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+wonderful salary, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How many more weeks have you to go before your contract is finished?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another four,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\we‚M-^@M-^Yre playing in Cadiz next week, in Seville$
+the week after, then Malaga, then Granada.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you like it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like it!‚M-^@M-^] the scorn in her voice was her answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The dresses belong to the troupe, I guess,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Get into your$
+street clothes and I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, eyeing him narrowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good your lost contract,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an English girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Irish,‚M-^@M-^] she corrected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean Irish,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an Irish girl doing$
+this kind of thing with a lot of horrible half-breeds. You‚M-^@M-^Yve talent$
+enough for London or Paris. What about Paris? I know any number of$
+people there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Could you get me a good engagement?‚M-^@M-^] she asked eagerly.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys your name, anyway?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never mind about my name. Smith, Brown, Jones, Robinson‚M-^@M-^Tanything you$
+like.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was the agitated little manager who interfered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you must not persuade this lady to leave the theatre. I$
+have her under heavy penalties. I can bring her before the judge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now just forget that!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there is no judge in Tangier.$
+She is a British subject, and the most you can do is to take her before$
+the British Consul.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When she returns to Spain‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said the little man growing apoplectic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She will not return to Spain. She will go to Gibraltar if she goes$
+anywhere,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and from Gibraltar she will be on the sea$
+until she reaches a British port.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will go to the Spanish Consul,‚M-^@M-^] screamed the little manager, clawing$
+the air. ‚M-^@M-^\I will not be robbed. You shall not interfere with my$
+business, you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Much of this, thought Cartwright, was intended for the glowering young$
+Spaniard who stood in the background. He went outside, closed the door$
+and stood with his back toward it. On a whispered instruction from his$
+employer‚M-^@M-^Ys son, whose hands were now flickering fire as he gesticulated$
+in his excitement, Jose the manager disappeared, and returned a few$
+minutes later with two stalwart stage hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Will you leave this theatre at once and quietly?‚M-^@M-^] demanded the foaming$
+manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not leave the theatre until I am ready,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+if I leave otherwise, I shall certainly not leave quietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The manager stood back with a melodramatic gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eject the caballero,‚M-^@M-^] he said finely.$
+$
+The two men hesitated. Then one came forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The se√±or must leave,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In good time, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+A hand gripped his arm, but instantly he had shaken free, and had driven$
+with all his strength at the man‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw. The stage hand dropped like a$
+log. He pushed at the door behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put your kimono over your things,‚M-^@M-^] he said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\You can send the$
+stage kit back to-morrow. There is going to be a rough house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All right,‚M-^@M-^] said a voice behind him, and the girl slipped out, still in$
+her kimono and carrying a bundle of clothes under her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know the way out? I‚M-^@M-^Yll follow you. Now, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he said flippantly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going‚M-^@M-^Tquietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER II$
+$
+$
+HE left behind him a pandemonium of sound and a scintillation of$
+flickering diamonds. He found the girl waiting for him in the darkness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Br-r-r! It‚M-^@M-^Ys cold!‚M-^@M-^] she shivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you staying?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the little hotel opposite the British Consulate,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt much of a place, but it was the only room I could get‚M-^@M-^Tat the$
+price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better not go there,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll send for your boxes in the$
+morning. Give me those clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took them from her and put them under his arm, and she fell in by his$
+side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad to be out of it,‚M-^@M-^] she said breathlessly, taking his arm;$
+‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a dog‚M-^@M-^Ys life. I was going to quit to-morrow. Those boys have been$
+following me round ever since I came to Tangier. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better go back to my hotel, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a moment; ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+pretty tough crowd, these Spaniards, and though I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand their$
+beastly language, I know just what kind of happy holiday they‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+planning for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were in the town, passing up the street of the mosque, when she$
+asked him:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you taking me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the Continental,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like this?‚M-^@M-^] she said in dismay, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have an office in this street,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\you can go in and dress.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you outside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He showed her into the tiny room which served as the headquarters of the$
+Angera Gold Mining Syndicate, and sat on the irregular stone steps,$
+waiting until she was dressed. Presently she came out, a presentable and$
+an attractive figure.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just thought,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you had better to go the$
+Central‚M-^@M-^TI am staying at the Continental and it wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt look nice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been thinking something of the sort myself,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What about$
+my broken engagement? Were you joking when you said you would pay? I$
+hate talking about money, but I am broke‚M-^@M-^TJose owes me a week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good the money to-morrow,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I can give you a tenner$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the idea?‚M-^@M-^] she asked him again. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve read a lot of books, and$
+I know the knight errant business backwards. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt strike me as$
+being a something-for-nothing man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\It occurred to me when I saw you on the$
+stage, that you might be useful. I want a person in Paris I can$
+trust‚M-^@M-^Tsomebody who could look after my interests.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a business woman,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I hate business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Business is done by men,‚M-^@M-^] said he significantly. ‚M-^@M-^\And there are a few$
+men I want you to keep track of. Do you understand that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see,‚M-^@M-^] she said at last. ‚M-^@M-^\It is better than I thought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He did not trouble to ask her what she had thought, or what she imagined$
+he had planned, but saw her into the hotel, arranged for a room, and$
+walked slowly back to the Continental. He was in the vestibule of that$
+hotel before he remembered that he had left an eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel$
+and Member of Parliament smoking his cigar in a _loge_ of the Tangier$
+circus.$
+$

+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I missed you,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell the next morning. ‚M-^@M-^\When you remembered and$
+came to pick me up, I was on my way back‚M-^@M-^Twe must have passed somewhere$
+in the little Sok. What happened last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing much,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\I went round and saw the girl.$
+She was very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How amusing?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, just amusing.‚M-^@M-^] Vaguely: ‚M-^@M-^\I found her annoyed by the attention which$
+was being paid to her by a veritable Spanish hidalgo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you sailed in and rescued her, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\And what happened$
+to her after she was rescued?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I saw her home to her hotel, and there the matter ended. By the way,$
+she leaves by the _Gibel Musa_ for Gibraltar this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] Maxell looked absently at the letter he had in his hand, folded it$
+and put it away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is the mail in?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright, interested, and Maxell nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve had your daily letter from your kiddie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is not a baby letter, but it is very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How old is she?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She must be nine or ten,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is just coincidence, or whether it is fate,‚M-^@M-^] mused$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is a coincidence?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve got a kid to look after, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym in a sort of way$
+responsible for a bright lad. Mine is less interesting than yours, I$
+think. Anyway, he‚M-^@M-^Ys a boy and a sort of cousin. He has two fool parents$
+who were born to slavery‚M-^@M-^Tthe sort of people who are content to work for$
+somebody all their lives and regard revolt against their condition as an$
+act of impiety. I‚M-^@M-^Yve only seen the kid once, and he struck me as the$
+sort who might break loose from that kind of life and take a chance.$
+Otherwise, I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have interested myself in him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How far does your interest extend?‚M-^@M-^] asked Maxell curiously. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not$
+the sort of person, I should imagine, who would take up the unfortunate$
+poor as a hobby.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a something-for-nothing man, in fact,‚M-^@M-^] laughed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been told that twice in twenty-four hours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who was the other person‚M-^@M-^Tthe actress?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright roared with laughter and slapped the other on the knee.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No, I am not a something-for-nothing$
+person. I‚M-^@M-^Ym one of those optimists who plant fir cones so that I shall$
+have some good firewood for my old age. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what sort of a man$
+Timothy will make, but, as I say, he shapes good, and anyway, you and I$
+are in the same boat.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except this,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\that from what you say, you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+particularly interested in your prot√©g√©, and you don‚M-^@M-^Yt really care$
+whether he shapes good or shapes bad.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys true,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an experiment.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little girl is something more than that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell quietly;$
+‚M-^@M-^\she‚M-^@M-^Ys the only living thing I have any real affection for‚M-^@M-^Tshe is my$
+dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your niece, eh? Well, that gives you an interest which I have not. I$
+never had a niece and I should just hate to be called uncle, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Their conversation was interrupted at this point by the arrival of a$
+small man dressed in his best clothes. On his brow was a frown which was$
+intended to be terrible, but was slightly amusing. Jose Ferreira had$
+dressed and prepared himself for an interview which, as he had described$
+to his friends, could not fail to be at once ‚M-^@M-^\terrifying and vital.‚M-^@M-^]$
+For, as he had said: ‚M-^@M-^\This man has sliced my life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He began his speech to Cartwright as he had rehearsed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Estoy indignado‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T_‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright cut him short with an expression of mock fear.$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Horroroso!_ You are indignant, are you? Well, come, little man, and$
+tell me why you are indignant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] said the man solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\you have put upon me a humiliation and$
+a shame which all my life I shall regret.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The conversation was in Spanish, but Maxell was an excellent Spanish$
+scholar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, before Jose, still labouring under the$
+sense of his wrongs, could get going again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen to him and discover,‚M-^@M-^] mocked Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have taken from his$
+incomparable company its joy and its gem.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In other words, the amiable Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, yes, se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] broke in Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\For me it is ruin! The money I have$
+spent to make my company perfect! It is financed by one who is the$
+greatest man in Tangier and it is his son who tells me that, unless I$
+bring back this lady‚M-^@M-^Tfor me there is the street and the gutter,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+wept.$
+$
+Maxell looked slyly at his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys another chance for you to plant a fir cone,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+you find some use for this gentleman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright was not smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] he said crisply, ‚M-^@M-^\you are, as all Spain knows, a thief$
+and a rogue. If you associate with bigger thieves and bigger scoundrels,$
+that is your business. I can only tell you that you may think yourself$
+lucky I did not bring this case before the Spanish Consul. I assure you,$
+you would never have put your foot in Tangier again after the stories I$
+have heard about you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little Spaniard was open-mouthed and impressed. He was also a little$
+frightened. Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation had been at a venture, but he argued$
+that it was scarcely likely that, in an establishment of the description$
+which Mr. Ferreira controlled, there could have been no incidents which$
+reflected upon the manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything which is said about me is a lie!‚M-^@M-^] said the little man$
+vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I have lived a life of the highest virtue! To-day I$
+complain to the British Consul, and we shall see!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Complain,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This chance I will give you.‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Ferreira wagged a fat, stumpy$
+finger. ‚M-^@M-^\Restore to me Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and the matter shall go no$
+farther.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady has left Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] said the other calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\so it is clear$
+to you that I cannot restore her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She has not left,‚M-^@M-^] vociferated the Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\We had a man to watch the$
+boat leaving for the _Gibel Musa_ and she did not leave the pier.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She left the beach,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright patiently; ‚M-^@M-^\she was rowed out$
+by a boatman from the Cecil. At this moment she is half-way to$
+Gibraltar.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira groaned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is ruin for me,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps for you also,‚M-^@M-^] he added$
+ominously. ‚M-^@M-^\I can do no less than depart for Paris to lay this matter$
+before my excellent patron, Se√±or Don‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright jerked his head to the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Get out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and turned his attention to the newspaper which he$
+had picked up from the table.$
+$
+Maxell waited until the little man had gone, still seething with his$
+‚M-^@M-^\indignado,‚M-^@M-^] then turned to Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is rather a serious matter, Cartwright; what has happened to the$
+girl?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you hear? I have sent her to Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt leave a dog in that company. And from Gibraltar she goes home$
+by the first P. & O.,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you ‚M-^@M-^Xhming‚M-^@M-^Y about?‚M-^@M-^] snarled his companion. ‚M-^@M-^\The girl$
+is gone. I shall not see her again. It was an act of charity. Do you$
+disapprove?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you felt so bad about it. No, I$
+think you‚M-^@M-^Yve done the girl a very good turn. But in these days one$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt expect‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blessed is he that expecteth nothing, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright$
+sententiously, ‚M-^@M-^\for he shall not be disappointed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose that$
+the proprietor, whoever he is, cares a snap of his fingers about the$
+matter‚M-^@M-^Tit is his infernal son who will fire the adorable Jose.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+That afternoon the two men had an interview on the outskirts of the town$
+with a very plainly dressed Moor, who came to them so cautiously that$
+the observers might have been pardoned if they thought he was a$
+criminal. In the eyes of the divine rulers of Morocco he was something$
+more than a criminal, because he was an emissary of El Mograb, the$
+Pretender. There was a price upon the messenger‚M-^@M-^Ys head, and his caution$
+was, therefore, commendable. He brought a letter from El Mograb to$
+Cartwright, and it was a message of cheer.$
+$
+Maxell and his friend had gone out early in the afternoon and had waited$
+two hours under a scorching sun for the courier to arrive. For a man of$
+law, the fact that he was coquetting with the Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy did not$
+distress Maxell, who knew the history of the country too well to worry$
+very much about Sultan or Pretender. The Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys reign, marked with the$
+turbulence of people and the self-indulgence of monarch, was already$
+doomed. His uncle, El Mograb, a born leader of men and captain of seven$
+thousand well-armed soldiers, was but waiting the psychological moment$
+to strike; and Adbul, with his motor-cars and brass bedstead, his$
+geegaws and his frippery, would disappear into the limbo which is$
+especially reserved for extravagant and unstable rulers.$
+$
+The news from El Mograb was good. It reconfirmed the concession which$
+one of his shereefs had made on his behalf, and sent a message in$
+flowery Arabic‚M-^@M-^Ta message of thanks to the man who had supplied him with$
+the very necessary rifles.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That was news to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright as they rode back to the town. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you were gun-running, Maxell, or that you were so solid with$
+El Mograb.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I like El Mograb,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the many Moors who have$
+impressed me. You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that I have been visiting Morocco since$
+I was a boy and most of the chiefs are known to me personally. I knew El$
+Mograb‚M-^@M-^Ys brother, who was killed at Tetuan, and when he was a favourite$
+in court circles he entertained me at Fez.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his word worth?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is worth all the contracts that ever went to Somerset House for$
+stamping,‚M-^@M-^] said the other with emphasis. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you can go ahead with$
+your scheme.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go back to London and raise the money,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We shall want a$
+couple of millions eventually, but half a million will do to go on with.$
+You had better be with me in the big scheme, Maxell. There is nothing to$
+lose for you. You‚M-^@M-^Yll be in on the ground floor. What is the good of your$
+pottering about with your little Company‚M-^@M-^TI mean the Parent Company?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have faith in that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I know just the amount of my$
+indebtedness.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\The big scheme may mean$
+millions to you, and I shall want your help and guidance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell hesitated. The lure was dazzling, the prize was immense. But it$
+meant risks which he was not prepared to take. He knew something of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys financial methods; he had seen them in their working, and$
+had done not a little on one occasion to save Cartwright from the$
+consequences of his own cleverness. Yet, as he argued, Cartwright would$
+have no difficulty in raising the money from the general public, and his$
+presence on the board would certainly be a guarantee against his$
+companion departing from the narrow path.$
+$
+Although it was not generally known that he was associated in any of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises, there had been a whisper of an inquiry in$
+influential quarters, and it had been hinted to him that, on the whole,$
+it would be better if he kept himself aloof from the gentleman who,$
+admirable business man as he was, had a passion for enterprises which$
+occasionally verged upon the illegal. But those influential quarters had$
+not whispered anything in the shape of a definite promise that his$
+welfare was entirely in their keeping and that his future would not be$
+overlooked.$
+$
+He was an ambitious man, but his ambitions ran in realisable directions.$
+The services he had rendered to the Government were such as deserved a$
+recognition, and the only question was what form that recognition would$
+take? His knowledge of languages qualified him for an important$
+appointment under the Foreign Office; but the Foreign Office was a close$
+preserve and difficult to break into. There were too many permanent$
+officials who regarded the service as a family affair, and were jealous$
+of patronage outside their own charmed circle.$
+$
+He went in to lunch that day to find Cartwright reading a telegram which$
+he folded up and put into his pocket upon the other‚M-^@M-^Ys appearance.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little friend has arrived in Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+Maxell looked at him curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens now?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym sending her home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys voice was brisk and he spoke in the manner of a man$
+referring to a topic too unimportant to be discussed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^] pursued Maxell, and the other shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have given her a letter of introduction to a friend of mine,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+carelessly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have one or two theatrical interests in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell said nothing, and could have dismissed the matter as lightly as$
+his companion, for the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys future scarcely interested him.$
+$
+She had been but a figure on the stage; her personality, her very$
+appearance, left no definite impression. But if he was not interested in$
+the girl, he was interested in Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private mind. Here was a man$
+of whom he could not know too much. And somehow he felt that he had$
+hardly cracked the surface of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys character though he had known$
+him for years, and though they were working together to a common end.$
+$
+The way of a man with a maid is wonderful, but it is also instructive to$
+the cold-blooded onlooker, who discovers in that way a kind of creature$
+he has never met before; a new man, so entirely different from the$
+familiar being he had met in club or drawing-room as to be almost$
+unrecognisable. And he wanted to know just this side of Cartwright,$
+because it was the side on which he had scarcely any information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you won‚M-^@M-^Yt see her again?‚M-^@M-^] he said, playing with his knife and$
+looking abstractedly out of the window.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt think so,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, and then, with a sudden$
+irritation: ‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you driving at, Maxell? I may see the$
+girl‚M-^@M-^TI go to music-halls, and it is hardly likely I should miss her.$
+Naturally I am interested in the lady I have rescued from this kind of$
+thing‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The waved his hand vaguely toward Tangier Bay‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and she may be$
+useful. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to say _you‚M-^@M-^Yre_ struck on her?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He tried to carry war into the enemy‚M-^@M-^Ys camp and failed, for Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+blue eyes met his steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know what she looks like,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am not likely to$
+fall in love with a lady who left absolutely no impression upon me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+He left next day on the boat for Cadiz, _en route_ to Paris and London,$
+and he and Cartwright had as a fellow-passenger a shabby little man$
+whose belongings were packed in an American-cloth suit-case inscribed in$
+flourishing capitals, evidently by the owner, ‚M-^@M-^\Jose Ferreira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira spent most of his time on the ship‚M-^@M-^Ys deck, biting his nails$
+and enlarging his grievance against the unconscious Cartwright.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER III$
+$
+$
+MAXELL did not stay many hours in Paris. The Sud Express landed him in$
+the French capital at seven in the morning. He left Paris by the midday$
+train for London. The Long Vacation was drawing to an end, and there$
+were briefs of certain importance requiring examination. There was also$
+a consultation with the Attorney-General on an interpretation of a$
+clause in the new Shipping Act, and he was also due to address his$
+constituents before the reassembling of Parliament.$
+$
+He might ruminate in vain to find one attractive feature of his$
+programme. Parliament wearied him, and the ordinary practices of the law$
+no longer gave him pleasure.$
+$
+There was an interest in the work he was doing for the Government, and$
+if he had the faintest hint of pleasure in his immediate prospects, the$
+cause was to be found in the vexed problems centring about this new, and$
+loosely drawn, shipping law. It was a measure which had been passed in a$
+hurry, and when the acid test of litigation had been applied, some of$
+its weak points had been discovered.$
+$
+The weakest of these points was one affecting the load-line. In an$
+action heard before a High Court Judge, the doubtful clause had been$
+interpreted so as to render the Act a dead letter; and there were$
+particular and especial Governmental reasons why the appeal which the$
+Government had made from the verdict of the lower Court should upset$
+that decision.$
+$
+There is no need to give the particulars of the great dispute, which$
+arose over the three words ‚M-^@M-^\or otherwise loaded,‚M-^@M-^] and it is only$
+necessary to say that, before he had reached London, Mr. Maxell had$
+discovered a way for the Government out of their difficulty.$
+$
+It was this opinion which he delivered to a relieved Attorney-General,$
+and, with the new argument, the Government were able to present so$
+strong a case to the Court of Appeal, that a month after his return the$
+verdict of the lower Court was reversed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney-General, ‚M-^@M-^\the devils can take it to the House$
+of Lords now and still lose‚M-^@M-^Tthanks to your brain wave, Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were smoking in the Crown Room at the Law Courts after the decision$
+had been delivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where have you been for your holiday, by the way?‚M-^@M-^] asked the Attorney$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco?‚M-^@M-^] The Attorney nodded thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you hear anything of$
+friend Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We were staying at the same hotel,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A weird person,‚M-^@M-^] said the thoughtful Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\A very curious$
+man‚M-^@M-^Twhat a Chancellor that fellow would make!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He never struck me that way,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know him well‚M-^@M-^TI mean, are you a particular friend of his?‚M-^@M-^]$
+demanded the Attorney.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\I know him‚M-^@M-^Tso many men in the law$
+know him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not by any chance associating with him in business now, are$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell promptly.$
+$
+It was a lie and he knew it was a lie. It was told deliberately from the$
+desire to stand well in the eyes of his friends. He knew Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reputation well enough, and just how he was regarded by the party whom$
+he had served for three years. Cartwright had been Member for a London$
+borough, but had resigned. ‚M-^@M-^\Pressure of business‚M-^@M-^] was the excuse he$
+gave, but there were people who said that it was owing to the pressure$
+of the Party Whips, who smelt a somewhat unsavoury case coming into$
+Court with Cartwright figuring prominently.$
+$
+There is no way of proving or disproving the statement, because the case$
+in which Cartwright most decidedly was interested was withdrawn from the$
+list at the last moment. The uncharitable say that it cost Cartwright a$
+small fortune to bring about this withdrawal, and certainly one of the$
+ladies interested (she was a small-part actress at the Hippoceus) gave$
+up her stage work and had been living in affluence ever since.$
+Cartwright pooh-poohed the suggestion that the case held anything$
+sensational‚M-^@M-^Tbut he did not enter political life again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with him,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney simply.$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an awfully nice fellow and I suppose he is as straight and as$
+sound as the best man in the City. But he‚M-^@M-^Ys a shifty fellow‚M-^@M-^Tjust a$
+little bit‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\a little wrong. You understand, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tor$
+shall we say slightly shop-soiled?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is certainly a brilliant man,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, not desirous of$
+defending his friend too vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I suppose he is,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\All men like that are$
+brilliant. What a pity his genius does not run in a smooth channel, but$
+must follow the course of a burning cracker, here, there and everywhere,$
+exploding at every turn!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped down from the table, on the edge of which he had been sitting$
+and pulled off his robe.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad to know you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with Cartwright, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said.$
+$
+Maxell did not attempt to probe beneath the surface of his$
+twice-repeated remark.$
+$
+He went back to Cavendish Square to his flat and to a tiny, solemn-eyed$
+little girl who had been brought up from Hindhead that day on her$
+monthly visit to ‚M-^@M-^\Uncle Max.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright had not accompanied his friend to England, and with good$
+reasons. A great deal of his work was carried out in Paris, where he had$
+an important financial backing. He occupied a flat overlooking the$
+imposing, but none too convenient, Avenue of the Grand Army. His home$
+was at the unfashionable end of this interminable thoroughfare, which$
+meant that his rooms were larger and his rent cheaper, and that he was$
+freer from observation than he would have been had he lived according to$
+his means or station in a luxurious flat nearer the Etoil.$
+$
+He had a board meeting to attend, an informal board meeting, it is true,$
+but none the less important.$
+$
+Cartwright was the chairman and managing director of the London and$
+Paris Gold Syndicate, a flourishing concern which held big blocks of$
+shares in various land and gold-mining companies, and controlled three$
+mines of its own on the West Rand. Though a Company drawing a modest$
+revenue from its Johannesburg property, its operations were not confined$
+to gold development pure and simple. It was, in fact, an outside$
+broker‚M-^@M-^Ys on a grand scale. It gambled heavily and gambled wisely. The$
+shareholders seldom received less than a twelve and a half per cent.$
+dividend, and there were years when in addition it paid a bonus equal to$
+its own share capital.$
+$
+It numbered its clients at one hundred and fifty thousand, the majority$
+being small people who preferred speculation to investment‚M-^@M-^Tcountry$
+parsons, doctors and the small gamblers who lived fearfully on the$
+fringe of high finance. The shares were at a premium and Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+interest brought him a considerable sum annually. What probably$
+attracted the little speculator was the knowledge of the Company‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reserve, which stood in the balance-sheet at a respectable figure. It$
+was the question of these reserves that occupied the attention of the$
+four quiet men who met informally in the room of a Paris hotel.$
+$
+There were three to one against Cartwright, because none of his$
+companions could see eye to eye with him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is too dangerous, M. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Gribber, whose nationality$
+was suspect; ‚M-^@M-^\our risks are already high and we cannot afford, in my$
+judgment, to extend them. The money would be subscribed over and over$
+again if you went to the English public.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt we make the profit?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\we could borrow from our$
+reserve.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That we can‚M-^@M-^Yt touch!‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the cautious Gribber, shaking his$
+head violently. ‚M-^@M-^\My faith, no, we cannot touch that! For it is certain$
+that the lean years will come when our clients will require their$
+dividends.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not pursue the subject. There were other ways of$
+financing his Moorish scheme.$
+$
+The Benson Syndicate, for example.$
+$
+He spoke eloquently of this new venture, which was to have its$
+headquarters in Paris, and would be under the eye of his sceptical$
+co-directors. He mentioned names glibly and easily‚M-^@M-^Tnames that carried$
+weight in the financial world. The three men agreed that the Benson$
+Syndicate had the appearance of a safe investment.$
+$

+$
+More important was the business which brought Alfred Cartwright to the$
+St. Lazaire Station to meet a passenger a week later.$
+$
+She sprang from the train and looked round with doubting face, which$
+lighted the moment she saw the saturnine Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My! I am relieved,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I was scared to think you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be$
+here to meet me, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd only got a few pounds left.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You got my wire?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, and she smiled, showing two rows of pearly$
+teeth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym still mystified,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What is it you want me to do in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us eat first and talk afterwards,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You must be hungry.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym starving!‚M-^@M-^] she laughed.$
+$
+He had a car waiting for her, and whisked her off to a little street$
+leading from the Boulevard des Italiens, where one of the best$
+restaurants in Paris is situated. The girl looked about her with an$
+approving air. The gaiety and luxury of the place appealed to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My word!‚M-^@M-^] she said enviously; ‚M-^@M-^\do you come to lunch here every day?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know this place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve seen it,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but a three-franc dinner at Duval‚M-^@M-^Ys has$
+been my limit so far.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She told him how she had come to the Continent as a dancer, and had$
+‚M-^@M-^\starred‚M-^@M-^] in a tiny little cabaret in Montmartre as one of the ‚M-^@M-^\dashing$
+Sisters Jones,‚M-^@M-^] before she had been seen by the impresario who was$
+recruiting material for his tour through the Levant.$
+$
+Cartwright judged her to be nineteen, knew her to be extremely pretty,$
+and guessed that, under certain conditions, she would be presentable$
+even to the best of the circles in which he moved. He wondered, with a$
+grim smile, what Maxell, that austere and fastidious man, would say if$
+he knew that the girl was with him in Paris. Would Maxell accept her? He$
+thought not. Maxell was a thought straitlaced and in some ways was a$
+bore. But Maxell was necessary. He was a brilliant lawyer, and moreover$
+stood well with the Government, and there might come a time when Maxell$
+would be immensely useful. He could well afford to give the lawyer a$
+slice of the pickings he intended making, because Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys wants were$
+few and his ambitions on the modest side.$
+$
+Cartwright thought in millions. Maxell was a five-figure man. If all$
+went well with Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys scheme, undoubtedly he could well afford the$
+five figures.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happened to your friend?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl, as though divining his$
+thoughts: ‚M-^@M-^\The man you told me I was to keep away from. Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+want him to see me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does it really matter?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys in England, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is he?‚M-^@M-^] She was curious.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, a friend of mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And who are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, facing him squarely. ‚M-^@M-^\If I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see$
+anything of you in Paris, that Smith, Brown or Robinson business isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+quite good enough. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me, but I want to know who I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+working for, and what is the kind of work you want me to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright pinched his neck‚M-^@M-^Ta nervous little trick of his when he was$
+thinking.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business interests here,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt want me for an office?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously. ‚M-^@M-^\My education$
+is perfectly rotten.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you for an office,‚M-^@M-^] he replied with a smile. ‚M-^@M-^\And yet$
+in a sense I want you to do office work. I have a little syndicate here,$
+which is known as the Benson Syndicate. Benson is my name‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Or the name you go by,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How sharp you are! Well, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your name, if it$
+comes to that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She made no reply and he went on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want somebody in Paris I can rely upon; somebody who will receive$
+money, transmit it to the Benson Syndicate, and re-invest that money in$
+such concerns as I shall indicate.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt use long words,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\How do you know I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to rob$
+you? Nobody‚M-^@M-^Ys ever trusted me with money before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He might have told her that she would not be trusted with a great deal$
+at a time and that she would be carefully watched. He preferred,$
+however, an explanation more flattering to his new assistant. And not$
+only was it flattering, but it contained a big grain of truth,$
+expressing, to an extent, Alfred Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys creed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Women are more honest than men,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I should think twice before$
+I put a man‚M-^@M-^Teven my best friend‚M-^@M-^Tin the position I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting you. It$
+will be a simple matter, and I shall pay you well. You can live at one$
+of the best hotels‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, it is absolutely necessary that you should.$
+You may‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\you may be Madam Benson, a rich Englishwoman.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him from under perplexed brows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the good of asking me to do that?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a tone of$
+disappointment. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were going to give me a job I could do.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Ym a fool at business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can remain a fool,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing to do except$
+carry out a certain routine, which I shall explain to you so that you$
+can‚M-^@M-^Yt possibly make a mistake. Here is a job which gives you plenty of$
+time, pays you well, gives you good clothes and an auto. Now, are you$
+going to be a sensible girl and take it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She thought a moment, then nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it means lunching here every day, I‚M-^@M-^Yll take it,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+Thus was formed the remarkable Benson Syndicate, about which so much has$
+been written, and so many theories evolved. For, if the truth be told,$
+the Benson Syndicate had no existence until Cartwright called it into$
+being in Ciro‚M-^@M-^Ys Restaurant. It was born of the opposition he had$
+received, and its creation was hastened by certain disquieting telegrams$
+which arrived almost every hour from London.$
+$
+Cartwright was, as has been said, a man of many interests. The$
+door-plate of his office in Victoria Street, London, was covered with$
+the names of the companies which had their headquarters in the ornate$
+suite which he occupied. There were two other suites of offices in the$
+City of London for which Mr. Cartwright paid the rent, although he did$
+not pay it in his own name. There were syndicates and companies$
+innumerable, Development Syndicates, Exploitation Companies, Financial$
+and Mining Companies, all duly registered and all keeping one solicitor$
+busy; for the Companies Acts are tricky, and Cartwright was too clever a$
+man to contravene minor regulations.$
+$
+And to all these companies there were shareholders; some of them$
+contented, some‚M-^@M-^Tthe majority‚M-^@M-^Twholly dissatisfied with their lot, and$
+quite a large number who were wont to show their share certificates to$
+their friends as curiosities, and tell them the sad story of how they$
+were inveigled into investment.$
+$
+Only a clever company lawyer can describe in detail the tortuous$
+character of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys system of finance. It involved loans from one$
+company to another, very often on the security of shares in a third$
+company; it involved a system of over-drafts, drawn in favour of some$
+weakly member of his family, secured by the assets of one which could$
+show a bold face to the world, and was even quoted in the Stock Exchange$
+list; and divers other complicated transactions, which only the expert$
+mathematician could follow.$
+$
+Cartwright was a rich man, accounted a millionaire by his friends; but$
+he was that type of millionaire who was never at a loss for a thousand,$
+but who was generally hard up for ten thousand. He came to London much$
+against his will, in response to an urgent telegram, and, having cleared$
+the difficulties which his subordinates had found insuperable, he had a$
+few hours to attend to his private affairs before he took the train back$
+to Paris.$
+$
+His secretary produced a heap of small bills requiring settlement, and$
+going through these, he paused before one printed slip, and frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That boy‚M-^@M-^Ys school fees weren‚M-^@M-^Yt paid last term,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said the secretary. ‚M-^@M-^\If you remember, I mentioned the matter$
+to you when you were in London last. I was taking upon myself the$
+responsibility of paying the fees, if you hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt returned. The boy is$
+coming up to-day, by the way, sir, to be measured for some clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Coming here?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Cartwright, interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright picked up the bill.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he read. ‚M-^@M-^\What does T. A. C. stand for‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XTake A$
+Chance‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understood he was named after you‚M-^@M-^TTimothy Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the secretary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes; of course,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright grinned. ‚M-^@M-^\Still, Take A Chance isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a bad$
+name for a kid. When is he arriving?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He ought to be here now,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, looking at his watch. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+out and see.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He disappeared into the outer office, and presently returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The boy is here, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Would you like to see him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bring him in,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to meet this nephew, or$
+cousin, or whatever he is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He wondered vaguely what had induced him to take upon himself the$
+responsibility of the small child, and with remorseless judgment$
+analysed the reason as being personal vanity.$
+$
+The door opened and a child strode in. ‚M-^@M-^\Strode‚M-^@M-^] is the only word to$
+describe the quick, decisive movement of the bright-eyed lad who looked$
+with unflinching eye at Cartwright. Cartwright did not look at his$
+clothes, but at the grey, clear eyes, the firm mouth, extraordinarily$
+firm for a boy of fourteen, and the capable and not over-clean hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, son,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\So you‚M-^@M-^Yre my nephew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cousin, I think,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, critically examining the contents of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys table. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre Cousin Alfred, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym a cousin, am I? Yes, I suppose I am,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amused.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, ‚M-^@M-^\is that the school bill? The Head has been$
+rather baity about that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\‚M-^@M-^XBaity‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys a new one on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shirty,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy calmly. ‚M-^@M-^\Annoyed, I suppose, is the correct$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to be?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A financier,‚M-^@M-^] said T. A. C. Anderson promptly.$
+$
+He seated himself, leant his elbow on the desk and his head on his hand,$
+his eyes never leaving Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that‚M-^@M-^Ys a great scheme‚M-^@M-^Tfinance,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym a whale at$
+mathematics.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What particular branch of finance?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Other people‚M-^@M-^Ys finance,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy promptly; ‚M-^@M-^\the same business as$
+yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright threw back his head and laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And do you think you‚M-^@M-^Yd be able to keep twenty companies in the air at$
+the same time?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the air?‚M-^@M-^] the boy frowned. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, you mean going all at once? Rather!$
+Anyway, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The phrase struck Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take a chance? That‚M-^@M-^Ys curious. I called you Take A Chance Anderson just$
+before you came in.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, they all call me that,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,$
+they‚M-^@M-^Yre bound to stick a label on to a fellow with an initial like mine.$
+Some of them call me ‚M-^@M-^XTin and Copper Anderson,‚M-^@M-^Y but most of them‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a rum kid,‚M-^@M-^] said his cousin. ‚M-^@M-^\You can come to lunch with me.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+                               CHAPTER IV$
+$
+$
+MR. ALFRED CARTWRIGHT had the enviable faculty of placing outside of$
+his mind all subjects and persons which were unpleasant to think upon.$
+Possessing this power, he could as lightly dismiss the memory of$
+responsibilities, pleasant or unpleasant. He had scarcely left London$
+before he had waived Master T. A. C. Anderson into oblivion. To do him$
+justice, he had certainly speculated vaguely upon assuring his cousin‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+future; but his mind was so completely occupied with his own that there$
+was really not room for both‚M-^@M-^Tand Take A Chance Anderson had to go.$
+$
+He reached Paris by the evening train, and drove straight to the$
+apartment he had taken for his new prot√©g√©. He found her installed in a$
+very comfortable flat on the unfashionable side of the Seine, and was$
+welcomed with relief.$
+$
+Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had not entirely overcome her suspicions of the _bona$
+fides_ of her newfound acquaintance. Yet, since he had not made love to$
+her, but, on the contrary, had made it very clear that the part he$
+expected her to play in his schemes involved no loss of self-respect,$
+she was becoming reconciled to a relationship which, to say the least,$
+was a strange one. She had established herself in a third-floor office$
+on one of the boulevards, an uncomfortable and unaccustomed figure in an$
+environment which was wholly foreign to her experience, though there was$
+no need for her embarrassment, since she constituted the whole of the$
+staff, and the callers were confined to the postman and the concierge$
+who acted as office-cleaner.$
+$
+She was to learn, however, that a daily attendance at her ‚M-^@M-^\bureau‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute the whole of her duties, or fulfil all Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+requirements.$
+$
+It was not until after dinner that night that Cartwright revealed$
+himself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sadie, my young friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, between puffs of his cigar, ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+going to tell you just what I want you to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought I knew,‚M-^@M-^] she said, on her guard, and he laughed softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll never quite know what I want you to do,‚M-^@M-^] he said frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\until$
+I tell you. Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting it to you very straight. I want nothing$
+from you except service. And the service I require is of a kind which$
+you need not hesitate to give me. You‚M-^@M-^Yre an actress, and I can speak to$
+you more plainly than I could to some unsophisticated girl.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She wondered what was coming, but had not long to wait.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will tell you something,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\which is really more important$
+than my name, about which you showed so much curiosity. There is a man$
+in this city whom I want to get at.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is a man who has it in his power to ruin me‚M-^@M-^Ta drunken sot of a$
+fellow, without brain or imagination.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He went on to explain briefly that he himself was a company promoter,$
+and that he had an interest in a mine, as yet unproved, in Morocco.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is why you were there?‚M-^@M-^] she nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is exactly why,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Unfortunately, right in the$
+midst of the ground which I have either bought or secured mineral rights$
+over, is a block of land which is the property of this man. He is a$
+Spaniard‚M-^@M-^Tdo you speak Spanish?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is precious little!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt matter,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright shook his head. ‚M-^@M-^\He speaks English very$
+well. Now, this land is absolutely valueless to the man, but every$
+attempt I have made to buy it has been unsuccessful, and it is vitally$
+necessary at this moment, when I am floating a company to develop the$
+property, that his claims should be included in my properties.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his name?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] repeated Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\I seem to have heard$
+that name before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is pretty common in France, but not so common in Spain,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr.$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And what am I to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will get you an introduction to him,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys a man$
+with a fine eye for beauty, and in the hands of a clever girl could be$
+wound round her little finger.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see what you mean,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but nothing doing!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have told you that it is necessary for me to$
+acquire this property. I am taking you into my confidence, and I know$
+that you will respect that confidence. I am willing to pay any$
+reasonable sum, and I neither want you to steal it nor make any personal$
+sacrifice to serve my ends. I am willing to pay, and pay heavily.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you call heavily?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl coolly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For the property twenty thousand‚M-^@M-^Tfor you ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^]$
+suggested Cartwright, and the girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys got me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Tell me what your plan is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My plan is this,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\You will appear to Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^TI$
+will arrange that‚M-^@M-^Tas a wealthy young American lady who has been$
+spending the winter in Morocco. His property follows a little wooded$
+hill, one of the prettiest formations of its kind in the Angera country.$
+You must rave about that hill, never cease speaking of its beauty and$
+its attractiveness; and you must tell him that you would give anything$
+in the world if you could build a house amidst that beautiful$
+scenery‚M-^@M-^Tdo you understand me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is a man somewhat susceptible to feminine charms,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright$
+went on, ‚M-^@M-^\and, unless I am greatly mistaken, he will in one of his$
+obliging moods, offer you the land at a nominal figure, particularly as$
+he has been bitterly disappointed in his attempt to find gold.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl after consideration. ‚M-^@M-^\You promised me$
+that if I came to Paris you would get me a job in one of the theatres.$
+That is what I am after, and the only thing I am fit for. The other$
+business doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt seem decent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds!‚M-^@M-^] murmured Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a lot,‚M-^@M-^] agreed the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but how am I coming out of this$
+business? I come out hopelessly compromised.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait a moment,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly; ‚M-^@M-^\let‚M-^@M-^Ys have a clear understanding.$
+You don‚M-^@M-^Yt expect me to walk up to Se√±or Brigot the first time I meet$
+him, or even the second, and say: ‚M-^@M-^XYou‚M-^@M-^Yve a very nice property. What$
+will you sell it for?‚M-^@M-^Y That is not the kind of transaction you expect me$
+to conduct, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means just a little more than you say,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\it means$
+dinners and suppers and hand-holdings and stringing him along. And after$
+it is all over, where am I? I‚M-^@M-^Yve got as much respect for my character as$
+you have for yours, Mr. Mysterious. I want to come out well in this$
+business as you do, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to leave my name behind, or be$
+known in Paris‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the world‚M-^@M-^Tas a decoy duck. I‚M-^@M-^Yd do an awful lot$
+to please you, because I like you and because you‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me.$
+But ‚M-^@M-^Xan awful lot‚M-^@M-^Y does not mean making me so cheap that I am left in$
+the slightly-soiled basket. Do you understand what I mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amazed at the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys cool reasoning. He$
+had not given her credit for any of these fine sentiments she now$
+enunciated, and he was piqued, and at the same time a little pleased.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When you said you‚M-^@M-^Yd give me ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+sounded good. But it is not good enough. I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea in the back of my$
+mind that the matter is a much bigger one for you than you‚M-^@M-^Yve told me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How big do you imagine?‚M-^@M-^] bantered Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think it is big enough to ruin you,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\and that$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yd be willing to pay any price to get this property. Otherwise, you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+go to the man or send your lawyer in the ordinary way. Now, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want$
+your ten thousand pounds, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to make a proposition to you.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve said I like you and that‚M-^@M-^Ys no more than the truth. You told me you$
+were a bachelor and I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you that I‚M-^@M-^Ym man-free and heart-free. I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt say I love you, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt flatter myself that you love me. But$
+if you want this thing to go through, and if you want me to go down in$
+the mud to get it, you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to pay the price‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And the price is‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to marry me,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright could only gasp his admiration; and then he$
+began to laugh, at first quietly, and then, as the humour of the$
+situation gained upon him, so loudly that the other patrons of the Caf√©$
+Scribe turned to look at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a rum idea,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, keeping her eyes on his.$
+$
+He nodded to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a bargain!‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She looked at him as she put out her hand and took his, and slowly shook$
+her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My!‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You want that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys land pretty badly, _I_ know!‚M-^@M-^]$
+and Cartwright began to laugh again.$

+$
+Se√±or Brigot lived in some style for a man who was on the verge of ruin.$
+He had a small house at Maisons Lafitte and a flat on the Boulevard$
+Webber. He was a heavy, tired-looking man, with a dark moustache,$
+obviously dyed, and a short beard, bearing evidence of the same$
+attention. M. Brigot, like Mr. Cartwright, had many interests; but his$
+chief interests were his own tastes and predilections. It was Se√±or$
+Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys boast that, although he had lived for twenty years in Paris, he$
+had never seen Paris between the hours of six in the morning and one in$
+the afternoon. His breakfast hour was two o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. By six o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the$
+evening he was becoming interested in life; and at the hour when most$
+people retire to rest, he was in the prime of his day.$
+$
+It happened on a certain evening that M. Brigot, who usually met dinner$
+in an amicable frame of mind, sat down at his favourite table at the$
+Abbaye with a big frown, and answered the polite _ma√Ætre d‚M-^@M-^Yh√¥tel‚M-^@M-^Ys_$
+cheery ‚M-^@M-^\Good evening‚M-^@M-^] with a snarl.$
+$
+Amongst his many enterprises and few possessions, and this Mr.$
+Cartwright did not know, was the proprietorship and management of a$
+small, ramshackle wooden theatre in the town of Tangier. He was likewise$
+interested in several cabarets throughout Spain. But what pained him$
+most at the moment was not distressing reports from any of these, but a$
+six-page letter received that afternoon from his son, in which the hope$
+of the house of Brigot had explained his reasons for discharging$
+immediately a very necessary servant. Therefore Se√±or Brigot swore under$
+his breath and cursed his first-born.$
+$
+Coincident with the arrival of the letter had come one Jose Ferreira,$
+who had been detained for a week at Madrid. Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys mind was$
+occupied with Jose Ferreira when that worthy, smirking apologetically,$
+as though conscious of the shabbiness of his dress-clothes, sidled into$
+a seat on the opposite side of the table. Se√±or Brigot glared at him a$
+moment, and Jose Ferreira shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had telegraphed to me, I would have settled the matter,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Brigot, as though carrying on a conversation which he had broken off a$
+few minutes before. ‚M-^@M-^\Instead, like the fool you are, you come all the$
+way to Paris, wasting your time in Madrid, and the first I hear of the$
+matter is from my son.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was deplorable,‚M-^@M-^] murmured Jose, ‚M-^@M-^\but Don Brigot‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot!‚M-^@M-^] sneered the father of that worthy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot is a$
+monkey! Why did you take notice of him? Have you nothing else to do in$
+Tangier but to look after that flea-ridden theatre? Have you no other$
+duties?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The young se√±or was emphatic,‚M-^@M-^] murmured the apologetic Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\He$
+demanded that I should leave and what could I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot grunted something uncomplimentary. Whether it was intended for$
+his son or for Ferreira, it was difficult to say. Ferreira was content$
+to take it to himself.$
+$
+Half-way through the dinner Brigot became more human.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will always be quarrels about women, my good Jose, and it is your$
+business to be diplomatic,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\My son is a fool; but then, all$
+young men are fools. Why should you neglect my interests because Emanuel$
+is a bigger fool than ever? Only this week I intended travelling to$
+Tangier with the representative of a very rich syndicate who wishes to$
+buy my land.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same se√±or as before?‚M-^@M-^] asked the interested Jose, who was not only$
+the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, but was also the representative of the$
+rusty little gold-mining company which Brigot had floated.$
+$
+The other nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same cursed Englishman,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Quite unconscious of the fact that his master was cursing the very man$
+whom Jose had most recently cursed, the little man smiled$
+sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I also have a hatred of the English,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\With what insolence do$
+they treat one!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+For some time M. Brigot sat in silence, but presently he wiped his mouth$
+on his napkin, tossed down a tumbler of red wine, and crooked his finger$
+at his companion, inviting closer attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a day, or perhaps two, I shall send you back to Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] began Jose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre‚M-^@M-^Tbah!‚M-^@M-^] exclaimed the other scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\A donkey-driver$
+could look after the theatre! It is the mine!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The mine?‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other in some astonishment.$
+$
+So long had it been since a spade had been put to the ground, so long$
+had those hopes of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys been apparently dead, that the very word$
+‚M-^@M-^\mine‚M-^@M-^] had ceased to be employed when referring to the property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My Englishman will buy it,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot confidently. ‚M-^@M-^\I happen to know$
+that he has taken up property in the neighbourhood, and he has already$
+made me an offer. But such an offer! He shall pay my price, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, nodding as he picked his teeth, ‚M-^@M-^\and it will be a big price,$
+because it is desirable that I should have money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose did not ask the price, but his employer saved him the trouble.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Five million pesetas,‚M-^@M-^] he said confidently; ‚M-^@M-^\for such a price the$
+property will be sold, always providing, my friend, that we do not$
+discover gold before the sale.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose smiled weakly, a circumstance which seemed to annoy his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot irritably; ‚M-^@M-^\you have no brains! You think$
+that is a preposterous sum? Wait!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When his subordinate‚M-^@M-^Ys dinner was finished, Jose was dismissed$
+peremptorily. Brigot had a round of calls to make, a succession of$
+people to be visited; and whilst he might interview the little man at$
+dinner without losing caste, he had no desire to take him round to his$
+usual haunts.$
+$
+It was at the Abbaye at that golden hour when the price of wine soars$
+and all that is smartest in Paris is assembled in the big saloon, that$
+M. Brigot, who had reached a stage of geniality, met an entrancing$
+vision. Brigot saw the girl and her cavalier at one of the tables, and$
+recognised in the latter a well-known man about town. The latter caught$
+his eye and walked across to him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is your charming companion?‚M-^@M-^] whispered Brigot, whose failing was,$
+as Cartwright accurately surmised, a weakness for pretty faces.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is an American lady who has just come from Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+glibly.$
+$
+Cartwright had chosen Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys companion very well. In a few$
+minutes Brigot had crossed to the other table and taken a seat, was$
+introduced, and was in that pleasant glow of mind which comes to the man$
+of his class who is conscious of having made an impression.$
+$
+This ‚M-^@M-^\American widow,‚M-^@M-^] with her queer, broken French, her beautiful$
+eyes, and the charming distinction which goes best with good clothes,$
+was more lovely than any woman he had ever met‚M-^@M-^Tso he swore to himself,$
+as he had sworn before. The friendship progressed from day to day, and$
+so great was the impression which the girl had made, that Brigot was$
+seen abroad at most unusual hours.$
+$
+The patient Jose Ferreira was despatched on a mission to Madrid, partly$
+because Brigot was tired of seeing him hanging about, and partly because$
+there was some genuine business to be done in the capital.$
+$
+Sadie reported progress to her employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, yes, he‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy enough about me,‚M-^@M-^] she said complacently, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going a little crazy myself. How long is this to go on?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another week?‚M-^@M-^] suggested Cartwright, smiling approvingly at the gloom$
+on the pretty face. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you mentioned the fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve taken a$
+fancy to his land?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wanted to give it to me there and then,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but you know$
+what these Spaniards are. If I had accepted, there would have been$
+nothing for me but the front door.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right,‚M-^@M-^] agreed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He is the kind of fish you must play.$
+Did he say anything about other offers he had received for the$
+property?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He spoke about you,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\he called you Benson‚M-^@M-^Tis that your real$
+name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is good enough,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is queer,‚M-^@M-^] mused the girl, looking at him thoughtfully, ‚M-^@M-^\that I$
+never meet any of your friends in Paris, and that nobody knows you‚M-^@M-^Tby$
+name. I went down to your flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+confessed frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\and asked the concierge. You‚M-^@M-^Yre Benson there too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In my business,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary that one should be discreet.$
+The name which goes in London is not good enough for Paris. And _vice$
+versa_,‚M-^@M-^] he added.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a strange man. I suppose if you marry me in the name of Benson$
+it will be legal?‚M-^@M-^] she asked dubiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it will be legal. I‚M-^@M-^Ym surprised at a girl of your$
+intelligence asking such a question,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What is the$
+programme for to-night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled a little face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Marigny and supper at Corbets‚M-^@M-^Tsupper in a private dining-room.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it‚M-^@M-^Ys come to that, has it? Well, you ought to make good to-night,$
+Sadie. Remember, I am willing to pay up to fifty thousand pounds. It is$
+going to be a tough job raising that money, and it will break my heart$
+to pay it. But it will not only break my heart, but it will break me$
+everlastingly and confoundedly to pay the man‚M-^@M-^Ys own price‚M-^@M-^Tand his$
+property must be bought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll do my best,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have no doubt in your mind$
+that it is going to be hard.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+At one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock the next morning he sat reading in his room, when a knock$
+came to his door and the girl came in. She was half hysterical, but the$
+light of triumph was in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it!‚M-^@M-^] he repeated in wonder. ‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean he sold?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For ten thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthree hundred thousand francs. What do you$
+think of your little Sadie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you serious?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+She hesitated and closed her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt talk about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have to see him to-morrow at$
+his lawyers, and the property will be transferred to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She smiled grimly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The after-part will not be as pleasant as M. Brigot imagines,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I tell you, that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy‚M-^@M-^Tstark, staring mad. But I felt$
+an awful beast, and I think he‚M-^@M-^Yll kill me when he discovers I‚M-^@M-^Yve sold$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that worry you,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright easily.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER V$
+$
+$
+HE saw the girl down to her waiting auto, and went back to his rooms$
+to think. It was curious that at that hour, when the big trouble on his$
+mind seemed likely to roll away, that his thoughts flew instantly to$
+Maxell. What would the prim Maxell say, if he knew? He was satisfied$
+that Maxell would not only disapprove, but would instantly and without$
+notice sever all connection with the adventurous company promoter.$
+Maxell would be outraged, appalled. Cartwright smiled at the thought.$
+$
+He was under no illusion as to his own conduct. He knew he was acting$
+despicably; but this view he dismissed from his mind as being too$
+unpleasant for contemplation. Maxell was a prig‚M-^@M-^Ta necessary prig, but$
+none the less priggish. He was necessary, at any rate, to Cartwright.$
+Anyway, Maxell stood to win if the scheme went through.$
+$
+Cartwright had reached nearly the end of his financial tether, and his$
+whole future was bound up in the success or failure of the new$
+promotion. He had exhausted every bit of his credit in order to take up$
+the Angera property which he knew was rich in gold, and offered$
+possibilities which no project of his had offered before.$
+$
+He had milked his other companies dry, he had played with reserves; all$
+except his Anglo-Parisian Finance Company, where the directors were too$
+strong to allow him his own way; and, although Maxell was not aware of$
+the fact, his ‚M-^@M-^\partner‚M-^@M-^] had spent fabulous sums, not only in acquiring$
+the land itself but in purchasing other gold-mining property in the$
+region. It was a gamble, and a dangerous gamble. He was risking the$
+substance of his fortune for the shadow of unlimited wealth.$
+$
+Yet, was it a risk? he asked himself; with the properties that he could$
+include in his new North Morocco Gold Mining Association‚M-^@M-^Tthat was to be$
+the title of the new company‚M-^@M-^Tthere could be no doubt as to the result$
+of the public issue. The British public dearly love a gamble, and a$
+gold-mining gamble, with all its mysteries and uncertainties, more$
+dearly than any.$
+$
+He went to bed late, but was taking his chocolate and roll before a$
+little caf√© on the boulevard before nine. At half-past nine he was$
+joined by the girl.$
+$
+Cartwright had been undecided as to whether he should take his _petit$
+d√©jeuner_ outside or inside the caf√©, and had decided, since the morning$
+was bright and warm, to breakfast under the striped awning in full view$
+of the street. Such great events hang upon slight issues.$
+$
+Scarcely had the girl seated herself opposite to him, when a pedestrian,$
+passing on the other side of the boulevard, halted and stared. Mr.$
+Ferreira had sharp eyes and a wit not altogether dulled by his$
+monotonous occupation.$
+$
+Cartwright produced a bulky package from his pocket and laid it on the$
+table before the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put that in your bag and be careful with it,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\there are three$
+hundred thousand francs in notes. When the property is transferred to$
+you, you must bring the transfer along to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about your promise?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I will keep,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that you have the best$
+guarantee in the possession of the transfer. Legally, it is your$
+property until it is made over to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She sat looking at the package absently, and presently she said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to get me out of Paris at once. Otherwise I am due to leave$
+by the Sud Express‚M-^@M-^Twith Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is a train for Havre at two-fifteen,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He saw her into her car‚M-^@M-^Tanother indiscretion since it brought him out$
+of the shadow which the awning afforded, and gave the observer on the$
+other side of the road an unmistakable view.$
+$
+Brigot was waiting for her‚M-^@M-^Ta heavy-eyed, weary-looking man, whose hand$
+shook whenever it rose to stroke his short, pointed beard.$
+$
+His lawyer watched him curiously as he stepped forward to meet the girl$
+with hands outstretched. It was not the first time that he had seen his$
+client overwhelmed by a pretty face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything is ready, Nanette,‚M-^@M-^] said the eager M. Brigot. (‚M-^@M-^\Nanette‚M-^@M-^] was$
+the newfound name which Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady employed for this adventure.) ‚M-^@M-^\See$
+here, I have all the documents ready!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I have the money,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the girl as she put the package down on$
+the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The money!‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Brigot waved such sordid matters out of existence$
+with a magnificent flourish. ‚M-^@M-^\What is money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Count it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will do no such thing,‚M-^@M-^] said the other extravagantly. ‚M-^@M-^\As a$
+caballero, it hurts me to discuss money in connection‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But his lawyer had no sentiment, and had slipped the string from the$
+package and was now busily counting the thousand-franc notes. When he$
+had finished, he put them on the desk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you one moment, M. Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Brigot, holding the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and devouring her with his eyes, turned$
+impatiently.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The document, my friend, the document! Give me a$
+pen!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is one point in the deed I must discuss,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer firmly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\if mademoiselle will excuse us for a moment‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He opened the door of$
+his inner office invitingly and with a shrug M. Brigot followed him in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have told you, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\that I do not think your$
+action is wise. You are surrendering a property for a sum less than a$
+quarter of what you paid for it to a perfectly unknown woman‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\M. l‚M-^@M-^YAvocat,‚M-^@M-^] said the other gravely, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a lady who$
+to me is more precious than life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer concealed a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have often spoken to you about ladies who have been more precious to$
+you than life,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly, ‚M-^@M-^\but in their cases, no transfer of$
+valuable property was involved. What do you know of this lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know nothing except that she is adorable,‚M-^@M-^] said the reckless$
+Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\But for the fact that, alas! my wife most obstinately refuses$
+to die or divorce me, I should be honoured to make madame my wife. As it$
+is, what a pleasure to give her the land on which to build a beautiful$
+villa overlooking my gorgeous Tangier‚M-^@M-^TI am moving to Tangier very soon$
+to look after my other property‚M-^@M-^Tand to know that her blessed$
+presence‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer spread out despairing hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then there is nothing to be done,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I only tell you that you$
+are transferring a valuable property to a lady who is comparatively$
+unknown to you, and it seems to me a very indiscreet and reckless thing$
+to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They returned again to the outer apartment, where the girl had been$
+standing nervously twisting the moir√© bag in her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is the document, madame,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer to her relief. ‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or$
+Brigot will sign here‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The indicated a line‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and you will sign there. I$
+will cause these signatures to be witnessed, and a copy of the document$
+will be forwarded for registration.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl sat down at the table, and her hand shook as she took up the$
+pen. It was at that moment that Jose Ferreira dashed into the room.$
+$
+He stood open-mouthed at sight of the girl at the table. He tried to$
+speak, but the sound died in his throat. Then he strode forward, under$
+the glaring eye of his employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This woman‚M-^@M-^Tthis woman!‚M-^@M-^] he gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] cried Brigot in a terrible voice, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a$
+lady who is my friend!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Tshe‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthe man pointed to her with shaking finger‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\she is the$
+woman! She escaped! . . . The woman I told you of, who ran away with an$
+Englishman from Tangier!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot stared from one to the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre mad,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is the woman,‚M-^@M-^] squeaked Ferreira, ‚M-^@M-^\and the man also is in Paris. I$
+saw them together this morning at the Caf√© Furnos! The man who was in$
+Tangier, of whom I told the se√±or, and this woman, Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot looked at the girl. She had been caught off her guard, and never$
+once had the keen eyes of the lawyer left her. Given some warning, she$
+might have dissembled and carried the matter through with a high hand.$
+But the suddenness of the accusation, the amazingly unexpected vision of$
+Jose, had thrown her off her guard, and Brigot did not need to look$
+twice at her to know that the charges of his subordinate were justified.$
+She was not a born conspirator, nor was she used to intrigues of this$
+character.$
+$
+Brigot gripped her by the arm and pulled her from the chair. He was half$
+mad with rage and humiliation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the name of this man?‚M-^@M-^] he hissed. ‚M-^@M-^\The name of the man who took$
+you from Tangier and brought you here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was white as death and terribly afraid.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson,‚M-^@M-^] she stammered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer and Brigot uttered the words together, and the Spaniard,$
+releasing his hold stepped back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it was Benson!‚M-^@M-^] he said softly. ‚M-^@M-^\Our wonderful Englishman who wanted$
+to swindle me out of my property, eh? And I suppose he sent you, my$
+beautiful American widow, to purchase land for your villa! Now, you can$
+go back to Mr. Benson and tell him that, if my property is good enough$
+for him to buy, it is good enough for me to keep. You‚M-^@M-^Tyou!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He made a dart at her with upraised hand, but the lawyer was before him$
+and gently pushed him back.$
+$
+He jerked his head to the girl and, shaking like a leaf, she stepped to$
+the door and went stumbling down the stairs, which she had mounted with$
+such confidence a few minutes before.$
+$
+Cartwright received the news with extraordinary equanimity.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has saved us the bother of going out of Paris,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\And it was my own fault. I never connected that infernal$
+fellow Ferreira with Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises. And anyway, we should not$
+have met in public. He said he saw us at the caf√©, did he?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did my best,‚M-^@M-^] she faltered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you did your best,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, patting her hand. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+tough luck, but it can‚M-^@M-^Yt be helped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was a long silence, then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about me?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Where do I come in? I suppose you have$
+no further use for my services?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course I have,‚M-^@M-^] he said genially. Then, after a longer pause, ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know that you‚M-^@M-^Yre the only person in this world that I have ever$
+taken so completely into my confidence and shown what, for a better$
+expression, I will call the seamy side of my business? I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to tell$
+you a lot more, because it would be a relief to me to get it off my$
+chest. But I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling you this, that if I marry you to-day, you‚M-^@M-^Yll have$
+to play your part to save me from everlasting ruin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ruin?‚M-^@M-^] she said, startled, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not the kind of ruin that means you‚M-^@M-^Yll go short of food,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but$
+the sort of ruin that may mean‚M-^@M-^Twell, ruin from my point of view. Now$
+you must understand this thing clearly, Sadie. I‚M-^@M-^Ym out for a big stake,$
+and if I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pull it off, it‚M-^@M-^Ys as likely as not that I‚M-^@M-^Yll go out.$
+You‚M-^@M-^Yre a clever, useful sort of kid, and I have an idea that you may be$
+even more useful. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys to be no sentiment in this marriage, mind!$
+You have just to sit here and hold tight and do as you‚M-^@M-^Yre told, and you$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got to pry into my business any further than I want you to. And$
+if I go away and don‚M-^@M-^Yt come back, you must reckon me as dead. I‚M-^@M-^Yve a lot$
+of business in America and elsewhere, which often takes me away for$
+months at a time, and you‚M-^@M-^Yre not to get uneasy. But if you don‚M-^@M-^Yt hear$
+from me‚M-^@M-^Twhy, you can go down to the Lafayette and buy yourself the$
+grandest little suit of mourning that you can afford!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I be able to afford it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall put some Rentes to your credit at the Lyonnais. That will give$
+you a steady income in case anything happens.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was troubled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite like this idea,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What will happen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Cartwright flicked away the ash from the end of his cigar and said$
+cheerfully:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That depends entirely upon the view which is taken of a certain$
+prospectus issued in London this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER VI$
+$
+$
+THE New Angera Syndicate was registered as a private company, and its$
+prospectus was not made public. Officially, the shares were not offered$
+to general subscription, and actually they had been subscribed‚M-^@M-^Tor the$
+first issue of five hundred thousand had‚M-^@M-^Tby a little group of shrewd$
+speculators in the City of London, who, before now, had made vast sums$
+from Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys promotions. The five hundred thousand shares brought$
+in about half that number of pounds, and nobody doubted that the$
+properties consolidated for the purposes of flotation included the block$
+of claims described in the prospectus as ‚M-^@M-^\lately the property of Se√±or$
+Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Gold had been found on the Angera reef, and gold in sufficient quantity$
+to make the new company a very promising speculation. That Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+property could be made to pay, had it been properly managed, was common$
+knowledge in the City of London. A dozen offers had been made for this$
+concession, but none had been quite acceptable to Se√±or Brigot, whose$
+estimate of the value of the mine varied with the passing hour.$
+$
+Probably, had it been possible to secure an interview with M. Brigot at$
+one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the afternoon, when he arose with a splitting head and a$
+dry throat, his possessions might have been acquired at the price of a$
+quart of sweet champagne.$
+$
+But, as the day progressed and his views of life became more charitable,$
+his estimate expanded until, by seven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the evening, which hour$
+he as a rule reserved for any business discussion, his figure was$
+awe-inspiring. Nobody in the City doubted for one moment that Cartwright$
+had purchased the property. Though his system of finance might not$
+commend itself to the barons and even the baronets of Capel Court, there$
+was no question of his honesty.$
+$
+Was it by some extraordinary fluke that Maxell, who had hitherto shared$
+in the profits of promotion, had kept aloof from this last and greatest$
+of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys flutters? No application for shares was ever found. He$
+heard (he said at a subsequent inquiry) in a round-about way of the$
+flotation, and saw a copy of the prospectus, and was a little worried.$
+He knew that when he had left Cartwright in Paris, not only was the$
+Brigot mine outside of his friend‚M-^@M-^Ys control, but there was precious$
+little prospect of bringing the Spaniard to a reasonable frame of mind.$
+$
+Cartwright must have done his work quickly, he thought, and have paid$
+heavily; and this latter reflection worried him even more because he had$
+a fairly accurate idea as to the condition of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private$
+finances. His private thoughts on this occasion are set forth in the$
+report of the Attorney-General‚M-^@M-^Ys Committee of Investigation.$
+$
+He was eating his solitary dinner in Cavendish Square when the telephone$
+bell rang and the voice of Sir Gregory Fane, the Attorney-General,$
+saluted him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should like to see you, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you come round to$
+Clarges Street after dinner?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Certainly,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell promptly, and hung up the receiver,$
+wondering what new difficulties had arisen, which called for a$
+consultation; for he was not on visiting terms with Mr. Attorney.$
+$
+In the tiny drawing-room of the house occupied by the Cabinet Minister,$
+Maxell was surprised to find another visitor waiting‚M-^@M-^Tno less a person$
+than Fenshaw, the Prime Minister‚M-^@M-^Ys private secretary.$
+$
+The Attorney-General came straight to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\we want your seat in the House of Commons.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The deuce you do!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, raising his eyebrows.$
+$
+The Attorney nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We also want to give you some reward for the excellent services you$
+have rendered to the Government,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But mostly‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This eyes$
+twinkled‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary to find a seat for Sir Milton Boyd‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+Minister of Education has been defeated at a by-election, as you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded. The communication was a surprise to him and he$
+wondered exactly what position was to be offered him which would involve$
+his resignation from the House. For one brief, panicky moment he had$
+connected Cartwright and his delinquencies with this request for an$
+interview, but the Attorney‚M-^@M-^Ys speech had dispelled that momentary fear.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quilland, as you know, has been raised to the Court of Appeal,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the Attorney, speaking of a well-known Chancery Judge, ‚M-^@M-^\and we are$
+departing from our usual practice by bringing over a man from the King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Bench to take his place. Now, Maxell, how does a judgeship appeal to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The K.C. could only stare.$
+$
+Of the many things he did not expect, it was elevation to the Bench,$
+although he was a sound, good lawyer, and the Bench is the ambition of$
+every silk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good!‚M-^@M-^] said the brisk Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\Then we will regard it as settled. The$
+appointment will not be announced for two or three days, so you‚M-^@M-^Yve a$
+chance of clearing up your more urgent work and preparing a letter for$
+your constituents. You might say a kind word for the new candidate who$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt particularly popular in your part of the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+One of Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys first acts was to write a letter to Cartwright. All$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys correspondence went to his London office, and was forwarded$
+under separate cover to Paris. It was a long letter, recapitulating$
+their friendly relationship, and ending:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This promotion, of course, means that we can no longer be$
+    associated in business, and I have instructed my broker to sell$
+    all the shares I possess in your and other companies forthwith.$
+    As you know, I have very definite views about the high prestige$
+    of the Bench; and whilst, in any circumstances, I feel that I$
+    can go to that dignified position with clean hands, my mind will$
+    be freer if I cut all the cords which hold me to commerce of$
+    every shape and description.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Three days later the letter came to Cartwright, and he read it through$
+with a thoughtful expression on his face. He read it twice before he$
+slowly folded it and put it into his inside pocket.$
+$
+Maxell was to be made a Judge!$
+$
+He had never considered that contingency, and did not know whether to be$
+pleased or sorry. He was losing the service of a man who had been a$
+directing force in his life, greater than Maxell himself ever imagined.$
+It was not so much the advice which he asked and received from the$
+King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel, but rather Cartwright had secured help by the simple$
+process of making a study of the other‚M-^@M-^Ys moods and expressions.$
+$
+He knew the half-frown which greeted some schemes, put forward$
+tentatively over the dinner table, and it was that little sign of$
+displeasure which could squash the scheme rather than any considered$
+advice which Maxell might have given. He was losing a good advocate, a$
+very sound legal adviser. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, it did not$
+matter very much. Fate had put a period to an old phase of life, and$
+many things had come to an end coincidently. He was taking his afternoon$
+tea when the letter had arrived, and the new Mrs. Cartwright marked with$
+interest the depression which followed the arrival of the mail.$
+$
+The new period was beginning excitingly, he thought. He had found a new$
+method of doing business, bolder and more desperate than any he had$
+attempted before; and with this development he had lost a man upon whom$
+he placed a great deal of reliance. Incidentally, he had just been$
+married, but this fact did not bulk very largely in his reckoning.$
+Maxell might serve him yet. The memory of an old business$
+partnership‚M-^@M-^Tfor in such an aspect did Cartwright interpret their$
+previous relationship‚M-^@M-^Tthe memory, too, of favours done, of financial$
+dangers shared, might serve him well if things went wrong. Maxell had a$
+pull with the Government‚M-^@M-^Ta greater pull, since he was now a Judge of$
+the Supreme Court.$
+$
+Maxell a Judge! It seemed queer. Cartwright had all the properly$
+constituted Englishman‚M-^@M-^Ys reverence for the Bench. In spite of much$
+experience in litigation, and an acquaintance with lawyers of all kinds$
+and stations, he reserved his awe for the god-like creature who sat in$
+wig and gown, and dispensed justice evenhandedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you had a worrying letter?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said, a little impatiently; ‚M-^@M-^\it is nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She had hoped for a glimpse of the envelope, but was disappointed.$
+Curiously enough, she ascribed the fact that her husband passed under a$
+strange name and would not divulge his own, to a cause which was far$
+from the truth, and was a great injustice to a man who, if he had not$
+given her his proper name, had given her a title to whatever name he$
+had. That thought she revealed for the first time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know what I think?‚M-^@M-^] she said unexpectedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you thought very much,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\In what particular$
+department of speculation does your mind wander?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] she answered. She was a little afraid of sarcasm,$
+as are all children and immature grown-ups. ‚M-^@M-^\It was about your name I$
+was thinking.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why the dickens don‚M-^@M-^Yt you leave my name alone?‚M-^@M-^] he snapped. ‚M-^@M-^\I have$
+told you that it is all for your good that I‚M-^@M-^Ym called Benson and known$
+as Benson in this town. When we go to London you will discover my name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know why you keep it dark.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why do I keep it dark?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, fixing his eyes on her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre married already.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her for a moment, and then burst into such a peal of$
+laughter that the girl knew her shot was wide of the mark.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a weird person,‚M-^@M-^] he said, getting up. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going out to see an$
+old friend of ours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of ours?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is the gentleman‚M-^@M-^Ys name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He won‚M-^@M-^Yt see you,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, won‚M-^@M-^Yt he?‚M-^@M-^] said the grim man. ‚M-^@M-^\I rather think he will.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot would not willingly have received one whose name was anathema,$
+but Cartwright got over the difficulty of his reception by the simple$
+process of sending up a card inscribed with the name of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys lawyer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You!‚M-^@M-^] spluttered M. Brigot, rising to his feet as the other entered the$
+room and closed the door behind him. ‚M-^@M-^\This is an outrage! It is$
+monstrous! You will leave this house immediately, or I will send for the$
+police!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, just keep quiet for a moment, Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, seating$
+himself coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see you as one business man to another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I refuse to discuss any business with you,‚M-^@M-^] stormed his unwilling host.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a scoundrel, a conspirator‚M-^@M-^Tbah! why do I talk to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre broke!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in calm, level tones, and he$
+used the Spanish word for ‚M-^@M-^\broke,‚M-^@M-^] which is so much more expressive than$
+any word in English.$
+$
+The conversation was carried on in this language, for Cartwright had an$
+intimate knowledge of its idioms and even of its patois.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your creditors in Paris are gathering round like hawks about a dead$
+cow. Your attempt to sell your Moorish property has been a failure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know a great deal,‚M-^@M-^] sneered Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Possibly you also know that I$
+am going to work the mine myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard that said of you for years,‚M-^@M-^] said he, ‚M-^@M-^\but the truth is,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre wholly incapable of working anything. You‚M-^@M-^Yre one of nature‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+little spenders‚M-^@M-^Tnow, Brigot, don‚M-^@M-^Yt let us quarrel. There is a time to$
+end feuds like ours, and this is that time. I am a business man, and so$
+are you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre as anxious to sell your property at a good price as I am$
+to buy it. I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to make you an offer.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot laughed sarcastically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded with gentle irony. ‚M-^@M-^\To build a house$
+for a beautiful American widow, eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright accepted the gibe with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to show you my hand,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will be infamously dirty,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot, who was in his bright six$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock mood.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know there is gold in the Angera,‚M-^@M-^] the other went on, without$
+troubling to notice the interruption, ‚M-^@M-^\and I know that, properly worked,$
+your mine may pay big profits.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will sell out,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot after consideration, ‚M-^@M-^\but at a price.$
+I have told you before I will sell out‚M-^@M-^Tat a price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But what a price!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, raising his eyebrows and with a$
+gesture of extravagant despair. ‚M-^@M-^\It is all the money in the world!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nevertheless, it is the price,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot comfortably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you what I am willing to do.‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright stroked his chin as$
+though the solution had just occurred to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I will float your$
+property in London, tacking on a number of other properties which I have$
+bought in the neighbourhood. I am willing to pay you two hundred$
+thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, six million francs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot was interested. He was so interested that, for the moment, he$
+could forget his animosity and private grievances. It was true that, as$
+Cartwright had said, his creditors were becoming noisy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In cash, of course?‚M-^@M-^] he said suddenly.$
+$
+Cartwright shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can have a portion in cash and the rest in shares.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] Brigot snapped his fingers. ‚M-^@M-^\I also can issue shares, my friend.$
+What are shares? Pieces of paper which are not worth their ink. No, no,$
+you deceive me. I thought you had come to me with a genuine offer. There$
+is no business to be done between you and me, Mr. Cartwright. Good$
+evening.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not move.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A portion in cash‚M-^@M-^Tsay, fifteen thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he suggested; ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+is a lot of money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To you‚M-^@M-^Tyes, but not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said the magnificent Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Give me$
+two-thirds in cash and I will take the rest in shares. That is my last$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This offer is open until‚M-^@M-^Twhen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Until to-morrow at this hour,‚M-^@M-^] replied Brigot.$
+$
+As Cartwright was going, a man tapped at the door. It was Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+‚M-^@M-^\secretary,‚M-^@M-^] who was also his valet. He handed a telegram to the$
+Spaniard, and Brigot opened and read. He was a long time digesting its$
+contents, and Cartwright waited for a favourable opportunity to say$
+good-bye. All the time his mind was working, and he thought he saw$
+daylight. Two-thirds of the money could be raised, and he could breathe$
+again.$
+$
+Presently Brigot folded up the telegram and put it in his pocket, and$
+there was on his face a beatific smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good night, Se√±or Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I will see you to-morrow$
+with the money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will have to be big money, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot, and there was a$
+note of exultation in his voice. ‚M-^@M-^\To buy my little property will cost$
+you half a million English pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know Solomon Brothers, the financiers of London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know them very well,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright steadily. He had good reason$
+to know Solomon Brothers, who had taken a large block of shares in his$
+new syndicate.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just had a telegram from Solomon Brothers,‚M-^@M-^] said Se√±or Brigot,$
+speaking slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and they ask me to give them the date when my property$
+was transferred to your syndicate. They tell me it is included in your$
+properties which you have floated. You know best, Mr. Cartwright,$
+whether my little mine is worth half a million English pounds to$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tespecially if I put a date agreeable to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blackmail, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright between his teeth, and without a word$
+left the room.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VII$
+$
+$
+HE went straight back to his flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army, and$
+the girl could see by his face that something had happened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might pack my bag, will you?‚M-^@M-^] he said almost brusquely. ‚M-^@M-^\I have a$
+letter or two to write. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to London. Important business has$
+arisen, and I may be gone some time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Wisely she asked no questions, but carried out his instructions. When$
+she came back from the room with a little gripsack packed, he was$
+blotting the envelope of the last letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Post these after I have gone,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I come down to the station and see you off?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The less you and I are seen together, the better, I think,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+with a faint smile.$
+$
+He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a cash-box. From this he$
+extracted a thick wad of notes, and, counting them rapidly, he tossed a$
+respectable bundle into her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may want this,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you have a regular income, but$
+you must keep in touch with the Lyonnais. For the moment I should advise$
+you to go to‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The looked at the ceiling for inspiration‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to Nice or$
+Monte Carlo. Keep away from the tables,‚M-^@M-^] he added humorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But‚M-^@M-^Tbut,‚M-^@M-^] said the bewildered girl, ‚M-^@M-^\for how long will you be gone?$
+Can‚M-^@M-^Yt I come with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is impossible,‚M-^@M-^] he said sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\You must go to the South of$
+France, leave by to-night‚M-^@M-^Ys train. Give your address to nobody, and take$
+another name if necessary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are things very wrong?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pretty bad,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry. I may be gone for a year, even$
+more. There are plenty of things you can do, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt go back into the$
+profession yet awhile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of taking up cinema work,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might do worse than go to America‚M-^@M-^Tif I am a long time gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stuffed the remainder of the notes into his pocket, picked up his$
+bag, and with no other farewell than a curt nod, left her.$
+$
+She was only to see him once again in her life-time.$
+$
+He crossed the Channel by the night boat and came to London in the early$
+hours of the morning. He drove straight away to his hotel, had a bath$
+and shaved. His plan was fairly well formed. Everything depended upon$
+the charity which Messrs. Solomon Brothers might display towards his$
+strange lapse.$
+$
+At breakfast he read in _The Times_ that ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Justice Maxell took his$
+seat upon the Bench‚M-^@M-^] on the previous day, and that paragraph, for some$
+reason, seemed to cheer him.$
+$
+At ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock he was in the City. At half-past ten he was interviewing$
+the senior partner of Solomon Brothers, a man with an expressionless$
+face, who listened courteously to the somewhat lame excuses which$
+Cartwright offered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was a mistake of a blundering clerk,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\As$
+soon as I discovered the error, I came back to London to withdraw all$
+the money which had been subscribed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a pity you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt come back yesterday, Mr. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Solomon.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\that we have already placed this matter in$
+the hands of our solicitors. I suggest that you had better interview$
+them.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright made a further pilgrimage to the solicitors of Solomon$
+Brothers, and found them most unwilling to see him. That was an ominous$
+sign, and he went back to his office in Victoria Street conscious that a$
+crisis was at hand. At any rate, the girl was out of the way; but, what$
+was more important, she, one of the principal witnesses in so far as$
+Brigot and his property were concerned, was not available for those who$
+might bring a charge against him. She was his wife, and her lips were$
+sealed, and this consequence of his marriage was one which he had not$
+wholly overlooked when he had contracted his strange alliance.$
+$
+What a fool he had been! The property might have been transferred and in$
+his hands, if he had not antagonised a wretched little Spanish$
+theatrical manager. But, he reflected, if he had not antagonised that$
+manager, he would not have possessed the instrument for extracting the$
+transfer from the amorous Brigot.$
+$
+At the top of a heap of letters awaiting him was one written in a firm$
+boyish hand, and Cartwright made a little grimace, as though for the$
+first time recognising his responsibility.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson; my lad, you will have to take a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and pushed the letter aside unopened.$
+$
+He lunched at his club, sent a brief letter to Maxell, and returned to$
+his office at two in the afternoon. His clerk told him that a man was$
+waiting for him in the inner office. Cartwright hesitated with his hand$
+on the door; then, setting his teeth, he stepped in.$
+$
+The stranger rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you Mr. Alfred Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is my name,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am Inspector Guilbury, of the City Police,‚M-^@M-^] said the stranger, ‚M-^@M-^\and I$
+shall take you into custody on charges under the Companies Act, and a$
+further charge of conspiracy to defraud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go ahead,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+All the week preceding the trial, Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys heart was filled with$
+warm, gratitude to his erstwhile friend. He did not doubt, when his$
+solicitor told him that Mr. Justice Maxell would try his case, that$
+Maxell had gone a long way out of his way to get himself appointed the$
+Old Bailey judge. How like Maxell it was‚M-^@M-^Tthat queer, solemn stick‚M-^@M-^Tand$
+how loyal!$
+$
+Cartwright had a feeling for Maxell which he had never had before. At$
+first he had feared the embarrassment which might be Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys at having$
+to try a case in which an old friend was implicated, and had even hoped$
+that the new judge would have nothing to do with the trial. He did not$
+despair of Maxell pulling strings on his behalf, and he realised that$
+much could be done by judicious lobbying.$
+$
+The charge against him was a grave one. He had not realised how serious$
+it was until he had seen that respectful array of counsel in the Lord$
+Mayor‚M-^@M-^Ys Court, and had heard his misdemeanours reduced to cold legal$
+phraseology. But he did not wholly despair. Brigot had been coming to$
+London to give evidence, and on his journey there had occurred an$
+incident which suggested to the accused man that Providence was fighting$
+on his side. The Spaniard had had a stroke in the train to Calais, and$
+the doctors reported that he might not recover. Not that Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+evidence was indispensable. There was, apparently, a letter and two$
+telegrams in existence, in the course of which Brigot denied that he had$
+ever parted with his property; and the onus lay upon Cartwright to prove$
+that he had acted in a _bona fide_ manner‚M-^@M-^Tthat was impossible of proof,$
+and nobody knew this better than Cartwright.$
+$
+And ever his mind reverted to the singular act of generosity on the part$
+of his old friend. He did not doubt for one moment that Maxell had$
+‚M-^@M-^\worked‚M-^@M-^] the case so that it fell to him to try it.$
+$
+It was a bright morning in May when he came up the steps of the Old$
+Bailey and took his place in the dock. Almost immediately after, the$
+Judge and the Sheriff entered from the door behind the plain oaken$
+bench. How well the judicial robes became Maxell, thought Cartwright. He$
+bowed slightly and received as slight a bow in reply. Maxell was looking$
+pale. His face was drawn, and there was resolution in his speech and in$
+his eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before this case proceeds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I wish to direct attention to a$
+statement in one of the newspapers this morning, that I was associated$
+with the accused in business, and that I am in some way involved,$
+directly or indirectly, in the company promotion‚M-^@M-^Teither as a$
+shareholder or an indirect promoter‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the subject of the present$
+charge. I wish to utter an emphatic denial to that statement.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He spoke clearly and slowly and looked the prisoner straight in the eye,$
+and Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can only endorse your lordship‚M-^@M-^Ys statement,‚M-^@M-^] he said emphatically.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your lordship has never had any dealings with me or any business$
+transactions whatsoever.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a minor sensation which provided a headline for the evening$
+newspapers. The case proceeded. It was not particularly involved and the$
+witnesses were few but vital. There were those business men who had$
+subscribed or promised to subscribe to the syndicate. There was Mr.$
+Solomon, who could give an account of his dealings with the prisoner.$
+But, most damning of all, was a sworn statement made by Brigot before an$
+English solicitor, a Commissioner of Oaths. And it was such a statement$
+which only documentary proof, produced by the accused man, could refute.$
+$
+Cartwright listened to the evidence untroubled of mind. He knew that his$
+counsel‚M-^@M-^Ys speech, delivered with such force, was little less than an$
+admission of guilt and a plea for mercy. The last word would be with the$
+judge. A verdict of ‚M-^@M-^\guilty‚M-^@M-^] there must necessarily be. But he thought$
+that, when later his counsel pleaded for a minimum sentence, he saw a$
+responsive look in the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+The stigma of imprisonment did not greatly distress Cartwright. He had$
+lived on the narrow border-line of illegalities too long; he had weighed$
+chances and penalties too nicely to bother about such ephemeral things$
+as ‚M-^@M-^\honour.‚M-^@M-^] His system of finance was reviewed, and certain minor$
+charges arising out of the manipulation of funds were gone into. It was$
+late in the evening when the Judge began his summing up.$
+$
+It was a fair, if a conventional address he delivered to the jury.$
+Obviously, thought Cartwright, he could do nothing less than call$
+attention to the serious nature of the charge, the interests involved,$
+the betrayal of shareholders, and the like. On the whole, the summing up$
+did not diminish the comforting sense that the worst that lay before him$
+was a few months‚M-^@M-^Y imprisonment and then a start in another land under$
+another name. He never doubted his ability to make money. The summing up$
+was ended, and the jury retired. They were gone twenty minutes, and when$
+they came back it was a foregone conclusion what their verdict would be.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Guilty,‚M-^@M-^] was the reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And is that the verdict of you all?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Justice Maxell was examining his notes, and presently he closed the$
+little book which he was consulting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The charge against Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is one of the most$
+serious which could be brought against a business man. The jury have$
+returned a verdict of guilty, and I must say that I concur in that$
+verdict. I am here in my place‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This voice shook a little‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to$
+administer and maintain the laws of England. I must do all that in me is$
+possible to preserve the purity of commercial life and the condition of$
+English commercial honesty.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright waited for that ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tit did not come.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In view of the seriousness of the frauds and irregularities which the$
+accused has committed, with a cynical disregard for the happiness or$
+fortune of those people whose interests should have been his own, I$
+cannot do less than pass a sentence which will serve as an example to$
+all wrongdoers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped and gripped the edge of the dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You, Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, and again looked him straight in$
+the eye, ‚M-^@M-^\will be kept in penal servitude for twenty years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright swallowed something. Then he leaned across the edge of the$
+dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You swine!‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily, and then the warders dragged him away.$
+$
+Two days later there was a new sensation. The newspapers announced that$
+Mr. Justice Maxell had been compelled, on account of ill-health, to$
+resign from the Bench, and that His Majesty had been pleased to confer a$
+baronetcy of the United Kingdom upon the ex-Judge.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VIII$
+$
+$
+SOME nine years after the events detailed in the last chapter, a$
+fairly clever young actress who had drifted into the cinematograph$
+business, faced one of the many disappointments which had made up her$
+life. In many ways the disappointment was more bitter than any she had$
+previously experienced, because she had banked so heavily upon success.$
+$
+If there was any satisfaction to be had out of the new tragedy it was to$
+be found in the fact that the fault was not entirely hers. An impartial$
+critic might, indeed, absolve her from all responsibility.$
+$
+In this particular instance she regarded herself in the light of a$
+martyr to indifferent literature‚M-^@M-^Tnot without reason.$
+$
+When the Westminster Art Film Company was tottering on its last legs,$
+Mr. Willie Ellsberger, chairman and chief victim, decided on one big$
+throw for fortune. The play decided upon does not matter, because it was$
+written by Willie himself, with the assistance of his advertising man,$
+but it contained all the stunts that had ever got by in all the photo$
+plays that had ever been produced, and in and out of every breathless$
+situation flashed Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, the most amazing, the most charming,$
+the most romantic, the highest salaried artiste that filmland had ever$
+known.$
+$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had come to London from Honolulu, after she had inherited$
+her father‚M-^@M-^Ys considerable fortune. She came, a curious visitor, to the$
+studios, merely as a spectator, and had laughingly refused Mr.$
+Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys first offer, that gentleman having been attracted by her$
+perfect face and the grace of her movements; but at last, after$
+extraordinary persuasion, she had agreed to star in that stupendous$
+production, ‚M-^@M-^\The Soul of Babylon,‚M-^@M-^] for a fee of ¬£25,000, which was to be$
+distributed amongst certain Honolulu charities in which she was$
+interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] she told a newspaper man, ‚M-^@M-^\this is to be my first and my last$
+film. I enjoy the work very much, but naturally it takes up a great deal$
+of my time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you returning to Honolulu?‚M-^@M-^] asked our representative.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] replied Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, ‚M-^@M-^\I am going on to Paris. My agent has bought$
+me the Duc de Montpelier‚M-^@M-^Ys house in the Avenue d‚M-^@M-^YEtoile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A week after the picture was finished, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady waited on the$
+chairman by appointment.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] said that gentleman, leaning back in his chair, and$
+smiling unhappily, ‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a flivver!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We ran it off for the big renter from the North, and he says it is$
+about as bad as it can be, and that all the good in it is so obviously$
+stolen, that he dare not risk the injunction which would follow the$
+first exhibition. Did Simmonds pay you your last week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, Mr. Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Ellsberger shrugged.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sets me back another twenty pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said and reached for his$
+cheque-book. ‚M-^@M-^\It is tough on you, Sadie, but it‚M-^@M-^Ys tougher on us. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+so sure that it is so tough on you, though. I spent a fortune$
+advertising you. There isn‚M-^@M-^Yt anybody in this country who hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt heard of$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and,‚M-^@M-^] he added grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yve more publicity than I hope$
+I shall get when this business goes into the hands of the Official$
+Receiver.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So there‚M-^@M-^Ys no more work?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl after a pause.$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys hands said: ‚M-^@M-^\What can I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You ought not to have any difficulty in getting a shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\with$
+your figure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Especially when the figure‚M-^@M-^Ys twenty pounds a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+unsmilingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I was a fool ever to leave Paris. I was doing well there$
+and I wish I‚M-^@M-^Yd never heard of the cinema business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Still young and pretty and slim, with a straight nose and a straighter$
+mouth, she had no appeal for Mr. Ellsberger, who in matters of business$
+had an unsympathetic nature.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you go back to Paris?‚M-^@M-^] he said, speaking very deliberately$
+and looking out of the window. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps that affair has blown over by$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What affair?‚M-^@M-^] she asked sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve friends in Paris,‚M-^@M-^] said the chairman, ‚M-^@M-^\good, bright boys who go$
+around a lot, and they know most of what‚M-^@M-^Ys going on in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, biting her lips thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Reggie van Rhyn‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble you heard about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what happened, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll never believe in a thousand years$
+that I stabbed him,‚M-^@M-^] she said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been too much of$
+a lady for that sort of thing‚M-^@M-^TI was educated at a convent.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger yawned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take that to Curtis, will you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\If he can get any free$
+publicity for you, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yll be glad. Now take my advice‚M-^@M-^Tstay on. I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+put Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady way up amongst the well-known products of Movieland,$
+and you‚M-^@M-^Yll be a fool if you quit just when the public is getting$
+interested in you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym in bad, but that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt affect you, Sadie, and$
+there ain‚M-^@M-^Yt a producer in England who wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt jump at you and give you$
+twice the salary I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She stood up, undecided. Ellsberger was growing weary of the interview.$
+He made a great show of pulling out notepaper and rang the bell for his$
+stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The publicity‚M-^@M-^Ys fine,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yve felt good about the$
+work. Why the letters that I‚M-^@M-^Yve had from people asking for my autograph$
+and pictures of my Honolulu estate‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe smiled a little$
+frostily‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\people in society, too. Why, a titled man who wrote to me$
+from Bournemouth, Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger was interested, indeed, he was fascinated. He waved away$
+his stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre sure it was Maxell? Sir John$
+Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys class there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And there‚M-^@M-^Ys money, too,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+get in touch with him, Sadie? A fellow like that would think nothing of$
+putting ten thousand into a picture if he was interested in a girl. If$
+you happen to be the girl, Sadie, there‚M-^@M-^Yll be a thousand pound contract$
+for you right away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Her straight lips were a trifle hard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you want is an angel, and the Judge is the best kind of angel you$
+could wish for.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has he got money?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] said the hands of Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\What a ridiculous question to$
+ask!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] he scoffed. ‚M-^@M-^\Money to burn. Do you mean to say you‚M-^@M-^Yve never$
+heard of Sir John Maxell, never heard of the man who sent his best$
+friend to gaol for twenty years? Why, it was the biggest sensation of$
+the year!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sadie was not very interested in history, but momentarily, by virtue of$
+the very warm and well punctuated letter which reposed in her bag, she$
+was interested in Sir John.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is he married?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl naturally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is not married,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger emphatically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Any children?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no children, but he has a niece‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got some legal$
+responsibility as regards her; I remember seeing it in the newspapers,$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys her guardian or something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger looked at the girl with a speculative eye.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you his letter?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded and produced the epistle.$
+$
+It was polite but warm. It had some reference to her ‚M-^@M-^\gracious talent,‚M-^@M-^]$
+to her ‚M-^@M-^\unexampled beauty‚M-^@M-^] which had ‚M-^@M-^\brought pleasure to one who was no$
+longer influenced by the commonplace,‚M-^@M-^] and it finished up by expressing$
+the hope that they two would meet in the early future, and that before$
+leaving for Paris she would honour him by being his guest for a few$
+days.$
+$
+Ellsberger handed the letter back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Write him,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and, Sadie, consider yourself engaged for another$
+week‚M-^@M-^Twrite to him in my time. He‚M-^@M-^Ys fallen for all that Press stuff, and$
+maybe, if he‚M-^@M-^Ys got that passionate admiration for your genius$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll‚M-^@M-^Tsay, you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to stay in the picture business and finish by$
+marrying that kind of trouble, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pointed through the wide windows to a youth who was coming across$
+from the studio to the office, swinging a cane vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Observe the lavender socks and the wrist watch,‚M-^@M-^] he chuckled. ‚M-^@M-^\But$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt make any mistake about Timothy Anderson. He‚M-^@M-^Ys the toughest amateur$
+at his weight in this or any other state and a good boy, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+kind of fellow that women like you marry‚M-^@M-^Tget acquainted with the$
+Judge.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+With only a preliminary knock, which he did not wait to hear answered,$
+the young man had swung through the door, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do, Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I saw your picture‚M-^@M-^Tfine! Good acting,$
+but a perfectly rotten play. I suppose you wrote it, Ellsberger?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wrote it,‚M-^@M-^] admitted that gentleman gloomily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It bears the impression of your genius, old bird.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson shook his head reproachfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It only wanted you as the leading man, and it would have been dead$
+before we put the titles in,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger with a grin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of the movies for good,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy Anderson, sitting himself$
+on a table. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a demoralising occupation‚M-^@M-^Twhich reminds me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped from the table, thrust his hand into his pocket, and$
+producing a roll of notes:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I owe you twenty-five pounds, Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Thank you very$
+much. You saved me from ruin and starvation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He counted the money across, and Mr. Ellsberger was undoubtedly$
+surprised and made no attempt to conceal the fact. So surprised was he$
+that he could be jocose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Fixed a big contract with Mary Pickford?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\N-no,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I struck a roulette game‚M-^@M-^Tand took a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Took a chance again, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\One of these days you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+take a chance and never get better of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pooh!‚M-^@M-^] said the other in derision. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you think that‚M-^@M-^Ys any new$
+experience for me? Not on your life. I went into this game with just$
+twelve pounds and my hotel bill three weeks in arrears. I was down to my$
+last half-crown, but I played it and came out with three hundred$
+pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Whose game was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Ellsberger curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tony Smail,‚M-^@M-^] and Mr. Ellsberger whistled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, that‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the toughest places in town,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a$
+wonder you came away with the money‚M-^@M-^Tand your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I took a chance,‚M-^@M-^] said the other carelessly, and swung his legs once$
+more over the edge of the desk. ‚M-^@M-^\There was some slight trouble when I$
+came out of Smail‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] he shrugged his shoulders, ‚M-^@M-^\just a little$
+horseplay.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had followed the conversation keenly. Any talk which circled$
+about finance had the effect of concentrating her attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you always take a chance?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Always,‚M-^@M-^] said the other promptly.$
+$
+This woman did not appeal to him. Timothy possessed a seventh sense$
+which he called his ‚M-^@M-^\Sorter,‚M-^@M-^] and Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady was already sorted$
+into the heap of folks who, had life been a veritable voyage, would have$
+been labelled ‚M-^@M-^\Not Wanted.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going by the next boat to New York,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\then I‚M-^@M-^Yll go to$
+California. Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll take in Kempton on my way, for a fellow I met at$
+the hotel has a horse running which can catch pigeons. Good-bye, Miss$
+O‚M-^@M-^YGrady. I wish you every kind of luck.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She watched him disappear, sensing his antagonism and responding$
+thereto. If he could judge women by intuition, she judged him by reason,$
+and she knew that here was a man whose mental attitude was one of$
+dormant hostility.$
+$
+It would be unfair to her to say that it was because she recognised the$
+clean mind and the healthy outlook and the high principles of this young$
+man that she disliked him. She was not wholly bad, because she had been$
+the victim of circumstances and had lately lived a two-thousand pound$
+life on a one-hundred pound capacity. She looked after him, biting her$
+lips as though she were solving a great problem.$
+$
+Presently she turned to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll write to Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+By a curious coincidence Timothy Anderson had the idea of approaching$
+Sir John Maxell also, though nearly a year passed before he carried his$
+idea into execution.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER IX$
+$
+$
+THE initials ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] before young Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood for$
+Timothy Alfred Cartwright, his pious but practical parent having, by$
+this combination, made a bid for the protection of the saints and the$
+patronage of Cousin Al Cartwright, reputedly a millionaire and a$
+bachelor. It was hoped in this manner that his position on earth and in$
+heaven would be equally secure.$
+$
+What Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chances are in the hereafter the reader must decide; but$
+we do know that Cousin Al Cartwright proved both a weak reed and a$
+whited sepulchre. Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys parents had departed this life two years$
+after Alfred Cartwright had disappeared from public view, leaving behind$
+him two years‚M-^@M-^Y work for a committee of Investigating Accounts.$
+$
+When his surviving parent died, the boy was at school, and if he was not$
+a prodigy of learning he was at least brilliant in parts.$
+$
+Though it was with no great regret that he left school, he was old$
+enough and shrewd enough to realise that a bowing acquaintance with the$
+differential calculus, and the ability to conjugate the verb ‚M-^@M-^\avoir‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute an equipment, sufficiently comprehensive (if you will$
+forgive these long words), to meet and defeat such enemies to human$
+progress as he was likely to meet in this cruel and unsympathetic world.$
+$
+He had a small income bequeathed by his mother in a will which was$
+almost apologetic because she left so little, and he settled himself$
+down as a boarder in the house of a schoolmaster, and took up those$
+branches of study which interested him, and set himself to forget other$
+branches of education which interested him not at all.$
+$
+Because of his ineradicable passion for challenging fate it was only$
+natural that ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] should bear a new significance, and since some$
+genius had christened him ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson the name stuck. And$
+he took chances. From every throw with fate he learnt something. He had$
+acquired some knowledge of boxing at school, and had learnt enough of$
+the art to enable him to head the school. Such was his faith in himself$
+and his persuasive eloquence that he induced Sam Murphy,$
+ex-middle-weight and proprietor of the Stag‚M-^@M-^Ys Head, Dorking, to nominate$
+and support him for a ten-rounds contest with that redoubtable$
+feather-weight, Bill Schenk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson took his chance. He also took the count in the$
+first round, and, returning to consciousness, vowed a vow‚M-^@M-^Tnot that he$
+would never again enter the ring, but that he would learn something more$
+of the game before he did. Of course, it was very disgraceful that a man$
+of his antecedents should become a professional boxer‚M-^@M-^Tfor professional$
+he became in the very act of failure‚M-^@M-^Tbut that worried him not at all.$
+$
+It is a matter of history that Bill Schenk was knocked out by Kid$
+Muldoon, and that twelve months after his initiation into the prize ring$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. Anderson‚M-^@M-^] fought twenty rounds with the Kid and got the decision on$
+points. Thereafter, the ring knew ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson no more.$
+$
+He took a chance on race-courses, backing horses that opened at tens and$
+closed at twenties. He backed horses that had never won before on the$
+assumption that they must win some time. He had sufficient money left$
+after this adventure to buy a book of form. He devoted his undoubted$
+talent to the study of other games of chance. He played cards for$
+matches with a broker‚M-^@M-^Ys clerk, who harboured secret ambitions of going$
+to Monte Carlo with a system; he purchased on the hire system$
+wonderfully cheap properties on the Isle of Thanet‚M-^@M-^Tand he worked.$
+$
+For all his fooling and experimenting, for all his gambling and his$
+chancing, Timothy never let a job of work get past him, if he could do$
+it, and when he wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt working for sordid lucre he was working for the$
+good of his soul. He went to the races with a volume of Moli√®re‚M-^@M-^Ys plays$
+under his arm, and between events he read, hereby acquiring the respect$
+of the racing fraternity as an earnest student of form.$
+$
+So he came by violent, yet to him easy, stages to Movieland‚M-^@M-^Tthat Mecca$
+which attracts all that is enterprising and romantic and restless. He$
+took a chance in a juvenile lead, but his method and his style of$
+actions were original. Producers are for ever on the look out for$
+novelty, but they put the bar up against novel styles of acting and$
+expression. Ellsberger had tried him out because he had known his$
+father, but more because he had won money over him when he had beaten$
+Kid Muldoon; but even Ellsberger was compelled to suggest that Timothy$
+put in two long years ‚M-^@M-^\atmosphering‚M-^@M-^] before he essayed an individual$
+r√¥le on the screen.$
+$
+Timothy was not certain whether his train left at ten minutes to seven$
+or at ten minutes past seven, so he arrived in time for the ten minutes$
+to seven, which was characteristic of him, because he never took a$
+chance against the inflexible systems.$
+$
+He reached New York without misadventure, but on his way westward he$
+stayed over at Nevada. He intended spending a night, but met a man with$
+a scheme for running a mail-order business on entirely new lines,$
+invested his money, and by some miracle managed to make it last a year.$
+At the end of that time the police were after his partner, and Timothy$
+was travelling eastward by easy stages.$
+$
+He came back to New York with fifty-five dollars which he had won from a$
+Westerner on the last stage of the journey. The track ran for about$
+twenty miles along the side of the road, the wager between them was a$
+very simple one; it was whether they would pass more men than women on$
+the road. The Westerner chose men and Timothy chose women. For every man$
+they saw Timothy paid a dollar, for every woman he received a dollar. In$
+the agreed hour they passed fifty-five more women than they passed men$
+and Timothy was that many dollars richer. There were never so many women$
+abroad as there were that bright afternoon, and the Westerner couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+understand it until he realised that it was Sunday‚M-^@M-^Ta fact which Timothy$
+had grasped before he had made his wager.$
+$
+Two months later he was back in London. How he got back he never$
+explained. He stayed in London only long enough to fit himself up with a$
+new kit before he presented himself at a solid mansion in Branksome$
+Park, Bournemouth. Years and years before, Sir John Maxell had written$
+to him, asking him to call upon him for any help he might require, and$
+promising to assist him in whatever difficulties he might find himself.$
+Timothy associated the offer with the death of his father‚M-^@M-^Tmaybe they$
+were friends.$
+$
+He was shown into the sunny drawing-room bright with flowers, and he$
+looked round approvingly. He had lived in other people‚M-^@M-^Ys houses all his$
+life‚M-^@M-^Tschools, boarding-houses, hotels and the like‚M-^@M-^Tand an atmosphere$
+of home came to him like the forgotten fragrance of a garden he had$
+known.$
+$
+The servant came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will see you in ten minutes, sir, but you must not keep him$
+long, because he has to go out to meet Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in surprise, ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know he was$
+married.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant smiled and said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Judge married a year ago, sir. It was in all the newspapers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt read all the newspapers,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt sufficient$
+time. Who was the lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man looked round, as if fearing to be overheard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John married the cinema lady, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and the$
+hostility in his tone was unmistakable.$
+$
+Timothy gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, that beats the band! Why, I knew that$
+da‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T, that lady in London!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant inclined his head sideways.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Indeed, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and it was evident that he did not regard$
+Timothy as being any fitter for human association by reason of his$
+confession.$
+$
+A distant bell buzzed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John is ready, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I hope you will not mention the fact$
+that I spoke of madam?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy winked, and was readmitted to the confidence of the democracy.$
+$
+Sir John Maxell was standing up behind his writing table, a fine, big$
+man with his grey hair neatly brushed back from his forehead and his$
+blue eyes magnified behind rimless glasses.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, coming round the table with slow steps.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely this is not the little Timothy I heard so much about years and$
+years ago!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is I, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I should never have known you. Sit down, my$
+boy. You smoke, of course‚M-^@M-^Teverybody smokes nowadays, but it seems$
+strange that a boy I knew in short breeches should have acquired the$
+habit. I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said, as Timothy lit his cigar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing to my discredit, I hope, sir?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he repeated diplomatically, ‚M-^@M-^\let it go at$
+that. Now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve come here because, five years ago, on the$
+twenty-third of December to be correct, I wrote to you, offering to give$
+you any help that lay in my power.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I won‚M-^@M-^Yt swear to the date,‚M-^@M-^] said Tim.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But I will,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the other. ‚M-^@M-^\I never forget a date, I never forget a$
+letter, I never forget the exact wording of that letter. My memory is an$
+amazing gift. Now just tell me what I can do for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I have had a pretty bad time in America. I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+running in a team with a crook and I‚M-^@M-^Yve had to pay out every cent I had$
+in the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded slowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then it is money you want,‚M-^@M-^] he said, without enthusiasm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly money, sir, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to try to start in London and I$
+thought, maybe, you might give me a letter of introduction to somebody.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, brightening up, ‚M-^@M-^\I think I can do that for you.$
+What did you think of doing in London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of getting some sort of secretarial job,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Not that$
+I know much about it!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John pinched his lower lip.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know a man who may help you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We were in the House of$
+Commons together and he would give you a place in one of his offices,$
+but unfortunately for you he has made a great deal of money and spends$
+most of his time at Newmarket.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds good to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance$
+there. Perhaps he‚M-^@M-^Yd try me out in that office?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Judge permitted himself to smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In Newmarket,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\our friend does very little more, I fear, than$
+waste his time and money on the race-course. He has half a dozen$
+horses‚M-^@M-^TI had a letter from him this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked back to his table, searched in the litter, and presently$
+amongst the papers pulled out a letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As a matter of fact, I had some business with him and I wrote to him$
+for information. The only thing he tells me is‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthis with a gesture of$
+despair‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\that Skyball and Polly Chaw‚M-^@M-^Tthose are the names of$
+race-horses, I presume‚M-^@M-^Twill win the two big handicaps next week and$
+that he has a flyer named Swift Kate that can beat anything‚M-^@M-^TI am$
+quoting his words‚M-^@M-^Ton legs over six furlongs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up over his glasses at Timothy, and on that young man‚M-^@M-^Ys face$
+was a seraphic smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds real nice to me,‚M-^@M-^] glowed Timothy.$
+$
+Remembering the injunctions of the servant, he was taking his adieu,$
+when his host asked, in a lower voice than that in which the$
+conversation had been carried on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you have not heard from your cousin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at him in astonishment. Had Sir John asked after the$
+Grand Llama of Tibet he would have been as well prepared to answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, no, sir‚M-^@M-^Tno‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tis he alive?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John Maxell looked at him sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alive? Of course. I thought you might have heard from him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\he disappeared. I only met him once when I was a$
+kid. Was he a friend‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tan acquaintance of yours?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John was drumming his fingers on the desk and his mind was far away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes and no,‚M-^@M-^] he said shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\I knew him, and at one time I was$
+friendly with him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly he glanced at his watch, and a look of consternation came to$
+his face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Great heavens!‚M-^@M-^] he cried. ‚M-^@M-^\I promised to meet my wife a quarter of an$
+hour ago. Good-bye! Good-bye!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He hand-shook Timothy from the room and the young man had to find his$
+way downstairs without guidance, because the manservant was at that$
+moment heavily engaged.$
+$
+From the floor below came a shrill, unpleasant sound, and Timothy$
+descended to find himself in the midst of a domestic crisis. There were$
+two ladies in the hall‚M-^@M-^Tone a mere silent, contained spectator, the$
+other the principal actress. He recognised her at once, but she did not$
+see him, because her attention was directed to the red-faced servant.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When I ring you on the ‚M-^@M-^Yphone, I expect to be answered,‚M-^@M-^] she was$
+saying. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to do except to sit round and keep your ears$
+open, you big, lazy devil!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But, my lady, I‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt answer me,‚M-^@M-^] she stormed. ‚M-^@M-^\If you think I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing better to do$
+than to sit at a ‚M-^@M-^Yphone waiting till you wake up, why, you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+mistaken‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys all. And if Sir John doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt fire you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about Sir John firing me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man with a sudden$
+change of manner. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve just had about as much of you as I can stand.$
+You keep your bossing for the movies, Lady Maxell. You‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to$
+try any of that stuff with me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was incapable of further speech, nor was there any necessity for it$
+since the man turned on his heels and disappeared into that mysterious$
+region which lies at the back of every entrance hall. Then for the first$
+time she saw Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you do, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She glared round at the interrupter, and for a moment he thought she$
+intended venting her anger on him. She was still frowning when he took$
+her limp hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre the Anderson boy, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked a little ungraciously.$
+$
+The old sense of antagonism was revived and intensified in him at the$
+touch of her hand. She was unchanged, looking, if anything, more pretty$
+than when he had seen her last, but the hardness at her mouth was$
+accentuated, and she had taken on an indefinable air of superiority$
+which differed very little from sheer insolence.$
+$
+A gold-rimmed lorgnette came up to survey him, and he was nettled‚M-^@M-^Tonly$
+women had the power to annoy him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt changed a bit,‚M-^@M-^] he bantered. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry your eyesight is$
+not so good as it was. Studio life is pretty tough on the eyes, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She closed her lorgnette with a snap, and turned to the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better see what Sir John is doing,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Ask him what he$
+thinks I am, that I should wait in the hall like a tramp.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was then that the girl came out of the shadow and Timothy saw her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is the ward or niece,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and sighed, for never$
+had he seen a human creature who so satisfied his eye. There is a beauty$
+which is neither statuesque nor cold, nor to be confounded with$
+prettiness. It is a beauty which depends upon no regularity of feature$
+or of colour, but which has its reason in its contradictions.$
+$
+The smiling Madonna whom Leonardo drew had such contradictory quality as$
+this girl possessed. For she was ninety per cent. child, and carried in$
+her face all the bubbling joy of youth. Yet she impressed Timothy as$
+being strange and unnatural. Her meekness, her ready obedience to carry$
+out the woman‚M-^@M-^Ys instruction, the very dignity of her departure‚M-^@M-^Tthese$
+things did not fit with the character he read in her face. Had she$
+turned curtly to this insolent woman and told her to carry her message$
+herself, or had she flown up the stairs calling for Sir John as she$
+went, these things would have been natural.$
+$
+Lady Maxell turned upon him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And see here, Mr. What‚M-^@M-^Ys-your-name, if you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of Sir John,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yll forget that I was ever in a studio. There are enough stories$
+about me in Bournemouth without your adding to the collection.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mother‚M-^@M-^Ys little thoroughbred!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy admiringly; ‚M-^@M-^\spoken like a$
+true little lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+In some respects he was wholly undisciplined, and had never learnt the$
+necessity of refraining from answering back. And the woman irritated$
+him, and irritation was a novel sensation.$
+$
+Her face was dark with rage, but it was upon Sir John, descending in$
+haste to meet his offended wife, that she turned the full batteries of$
+her anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know the time, of course. Your watch has stopped. It is hard$
+enough for me to keep my end up without you helping to make me look$
+foolish!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] protested Maxell in a flurry, ‚M-^@M-^\I assure you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can spend your time with this sort of trash,‚M-^@M-^] she indicated$
+Timothy, and Timothy bowed, ‚M-^@M-^\but you keep me waiting like a tailor‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+model at Sotheby‚M-^@M-^Ys, of all people in the world, when you know well$
+enough‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] pleaded the lawyer wearily, ‚M-^@M-^\my watch has certainly$
+stopped‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! You make me tired. What are you doing with this fellow? Do you$
+think I want reminding of movie days? Everybody knows this fellow‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+cheap gambler, who‚M-^@M-^Ys been fired out of every studio in England. You$
+allow your servants to insult me‚M-^@M-^Tand now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve brought this$
+prize-fighter to keep me in my place,‚M-^@M-^] and she pointed scornfully at the$
+amused Timothy.$
+$
+Half-way downstairs the girl stood watching the scene in silence, and it$
+was only when he became conscious of her presence that Timothy began to$
+feel a little uncomfortable.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, good-bye, Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry I intruded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\John, this man has insulted me! I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know$
+what he‚M-^@M-^Ys come for, but I suppose he wants something. He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of those$
+shifty fellows that hang around studios begging for money to bet with.$
+If you raise a hand to help him, why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I assure you,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John in his most pompous manner, ‚M-^@M-^\that this$
+young man has asked for nothing more than a letter of introduction. I$
+have a duty‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop!‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve a duty to me, too. Hold fast to your$
+money. Likely as not, you‚M-^@M-^Yll do neither with ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson$
+floating around.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was not her words, neither the contempt in her voice nor the insult$
+which stung him. The man who went twenty rounds with Kid Muldoon had$
+learnt to control his temper, but there was a new factor present‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+factor who wore a plain grey dress, and had two big, black eyes which$
+were now solemnly surveying him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is pretty difficult to give the lie to any$
+woman, but I tell you that what you say now is utterly false. I had no$
+intention when I came to Bournemouth of asking for anything that would$
+cost Sir John a penny. As to my past, I suppose it has been a little$
+eccentric, but it is clean, Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He meant no more than he said. He had no knowledge of Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+antecedents, or he might not have emphasised the purity of his own. But$
+the woman went back as though she had been whipped, and Timothy had a$
+momentary vision of a charging fury, before she flung herself upon him,$
+tearing at his face, shrieking aloud in her rage. . .$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He took off his hat and fanned himself. It was the first time he had$
+ever run away from trouble, but now he had almost flown. Those favoured$
+people who were in sight of Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys handsome villa, saw the$
+door swung open and a young man taking the front path in four strides$
+and the gate in another before he sped like the wind along the street.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy again.$
+$
+He went the longest way back to his hotel, to find that a telephone$
+message had been received from Sir John. It was short and to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt come again.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy read the slip and chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it likely?‚M-^@M-^] he asked the page who brought the message.$
+$
+Then he remembered the girl in grey, with the dark eyes, and he fingered$
+his smooth chin thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is worth while taking a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and$
+decided that, for the moment, it was not.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER X$
+$
+$
+LADY MAXELL yawned and put down the magazine she was reading. She$
+looked at her watch. It was ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. At such an hour Paris would be$
+beginning to wake up. The best people would still be in the midst of$
+their dinner, and Marie de Montdidier (born Hopkins) would be putting$
+the final dabs of powder on her nose in her dressing-room at the Folies$
+Berg√®res before making her first and her final appearance.$
+$
+The boulevards would be bright with light, and there would be lines of$
+twinkling autos in the Bois for the late diners at the Aromonville. She$
+looked across at the girl sitting under a big lamp in a window recess, a$
+book on her knees, but her mind and eyes elsewhere.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and the girl, with a start, woke from her reverie.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want me, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the matter with Sir John? You know him better than I do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know, Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt call me ‚M-^@M-^XLady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you to call me Sadie if you want to.‚M-^@M-^] There was a$
+silence. ‚M-^@M-^\Evidently you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want,‚M-^@M-^] snapped the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre what I$
+call a fine, sociable family. You seem to get your manners from your new$
+friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl went red.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My new friend?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Lady Maxell turned her back to her with$
+some resolution and resumed for a moment the reading of her magazine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt mind if you find any pleasure in talking to that kind of$
+insect,‚M-^@M-^] she said, putting the periodical down again. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, the world‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+full of those do-nothing boys. I suppose he knows there‚M-^@M-^Ys money coming$
+to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Very little, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little‚M-^@M-^Ys a lot to a man like that,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+think I am prejudiced because I was‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tannoyed the other day. That is$
+temperament.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the girl smiled, but it was a different kind of smile, and Lady$
+Maxell observed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can marry him as far as I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\These sneaking$
+meetings are not exactly complimentary to Sir John, that‚M-^@M-^Ys all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl closed her book, walked across to the shelf and put it away$
+before she spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yre speaking of Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I have met$
+him, but there has been nothing furtive in the meetings. He stopped me$
+in the park and apologised for having been responsible for the$
+scene‚M-^@M-^Tfor your temperament, you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked up sharply, but the girl met her eyes without$
+wavering.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt trying to be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] complained the older woman.$
+‚M-^@M-^\One never knows how deep you are. But I can tell you this, that sarcasm$
+is wasted on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sure of that,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked again, but apparently the girl was innocent of$
+offensive design.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say I met Mr. Anderson. He was very polite and very nice. Then I met$
+him again‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, I have met him several times,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\So far from his being a do-nothing, Lady Maxell, I think$
+you are doing him an injustice. He is working at the Parade Drug Store.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He will make a fine match for you,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will just$
+love having a shop-walker in the family!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+That ended the conversation for both of them, and they sat reading for a$
+quarter of an hour before Lady Maxell threw her magazine on the floor$
+and got up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John had a telegram yesterday that worried him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you$
+know what it was about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Honestly I do not know, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you ask$
+him yourself?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because he would tell me a lie,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman coolly, and the girl$
+winced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He brought all his money and securities from the Dawlish and County$
+Bank to-day and put them in his safe and he had the chief constable with$
+him for half an hour this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was news to the girl, and she was interested in spite of herself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to be frank with$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tfrankness pays sometimes. They called my marriage a romance of the$
+screen. Every newspaper said as much and I suppose that is true. But the$
+most romantic part of the marriage was my estate in Honolulu, my big$
+house in Paris and my bank balance. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys publicity man put all$
+that stuff about, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea that Sir John was highly disappointed$
+when he found he‚M-^@M-^Yd married me for myself alone. That‚M-^@M-^Ys how it strikes$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was a marriage which had shocked Society and had upset the smooth$
+current of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys life, placed in an entirely new light.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you very rich?‚M-^@M-^] she asked slowly, and Sadie laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rich! There was a tram fare between me and the workhouse the day I$
+married Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt blame him for being disappointed.$
+Lots of these cinema stars are worth millions‚M-^@M-^TI wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt one of them. I$
+married because I thought I was going to have a good time‚M-^@M-^Tlots of money$
+and plenty of travel‚M-^@M-^Tand I chose with my eyes shut.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was silent. For once Sadie Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys complaint had$
+justification. Sir John Maxell was not a spending man. He lived well,$
+but never outside the circle of necessity.$
+$
+The girl was about to speak, when there came a dramatic interruption.$
+$
+There was a ‚M-^@M-^\whang!‚M-^@M-^] a splintering of glass and something thudded$
+against the wall. Lady Maxell stood up as white as death.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was that?‚M-^@M-^] she gasped.$
+$
+The girl was pale, but she did not lose her nerve.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Somebody fired a shot. Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled aside the curtain. ‚M-^@M-^\The bullet went through the window.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Keep away from the window, you fool!‚M-^@M-^] screamed the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Turn out the$
+light! Ring the bell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mary moved across the room and turned the switch. They waited in$
+silence, but no other shot was fired. Perhaps it was an accident.$
+Somebody had been firing at a target. . . .$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go and tell my husband!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie. ‚M-^@M-^\Quickly!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl passed through the lighted hall upstairs and knocked at Sir$
+John‚M-^@M-^Ys door. There was no answer. She tried the door, but found it$
+locked. This was not unusual. He had a separate entrance to his study,$
+communicating by a balcony and a flight of stairs with the garden. A$
+wild fear seized her. Possibly Sir John had been in the garden when the$
+shot was fired; it may have been intended for him. She knocked again$
+louder, and this time she heard his step and the door was opened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you knock before?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\I was writing‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Then he saw her face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+The girl told him, and he made his way downstairs slowly, as was his$
+wont. He entered the drawing-room, switched on the lights, and without a$
+glance at his wife walked to the window and examined the shattered pane.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I imagined I heard a noise, but thought somebody had dropped something.$
+When did this happen? Just before you came up?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+Maxell looked from one to the other. His wife was almost speechless with$
+terror, and Mary Maxell alone was calm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has come already,‚M-^@M-^] he said musingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I did not think that this$
+would happen so soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked down to the hall where the telephone hung and rang through to$
+the police station, and the girl heard all he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is Sir John Maxell speaking. A shot has just been fired through$
+my window. No, not at me‚M-^@M-^TI was in my study. Apparently a rifle shot.$
+Yes, I was right‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Presently he came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The police will be here in a few moments to make a search of the$
+grounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I doubt whether they will catch the miscreant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it possible that it was an accident?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Accident?‚M-^@M-^] He smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly. ‚M-^@M-^\That kind of$
+accident is liable to happen again. You had better come up to my study,$
+both of you, till the police arrive,‚M-^@M-^] he said and led the way up the$
+stairs.$
+$
+He did not attempt to support his wife, though her nerve was obviously$
+shaken. Possibly he did not observe this fact until they were in the$
+room, for after a glance at her face he pushed a chair forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+The study was the one room to which his wife was seldom admitted.$
+Dominated as he was by her in other matters, he was firm on this point.$
+It was perhaps something of a novelty for her‚M-^@M-^Ta novelty which will$
+still the whimper of the crying child has something of the same effect$
+upon a nervous woman.$
+$
+The door of the safe was open and the big table was piled high with$
+sealed packages. The only money she saw was a thick pad of bank-notes$
+fastened about with a paper bandage, on which something was written. On$
+this she fixed her eyes. She had never seen so much money in her life,$
+and he must have noticed the attention this display of wealth had$
+created, for he took up the money and slipped it into a large envelope.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is your money, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he beamed over his glasses at the girl.$
+$
+She was feeling the reaction of her experience now and was trembling in$
+every limb. Yet she thought she recognised in this diversion an attempt$
+on his part to soothe her, and she smiled and tried hard to respond.$
+$
+They had been daily companions since she was a mite of four, and between$
+him and his dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child there was a whole lot of understanding$
+and sympathy which other people never knew.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My money, uncle?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I realised your investments last week,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I happened to know$
+that the Corporation in which the money stood had incurred very heavy$
+losses through some error in insurance. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a great deal, but I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt afford to let you take any further risks.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was, of course, a possibility of this shot having been fired by$
+accident,‚M-^@M-^] he went on, reverting to the matter which would naturally be$
+at the back of his mind. Then he fell into thought, pacing the room in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, stopping suddenly in front of the$
+girl. ‚M-^@M-^\You told me you were going to a concert.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before she could explain why she changed her mind they heard the sound$
+of voices in the hall.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stay here,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John. ‚M-^@M-^\It is the police. I will go down and tell$
+them all there is to know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When her husband had gone, Lady Maxell rose from her chair. The table,$
+with its sealed packages, drew her like a magnet. She fingered them one$
+by one, and came at last to the envelope containing Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys patrimony.$
+This she lifted in her hands, weighing it. Then, with a deep sigh, she$
+replaced the package on the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money there,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and Mary smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a great deal, I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid. Father was comparatively poor when he$
+died.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell thoughtfully; ‚M-^@M-^\more than I have ever$
+seen since I have been in this house, believe me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She returned, as though fascinated, and lifted the envelope again and$
+peered inside.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor, was he?‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you people don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what poverty$
+is. Do you know what all this means?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held the envelope up and there was a look in her face which the girl$
+had never seen before.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means comfort, it means freedom from worry, it means that you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have to pretend and make love to men whom you loathe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had risen and was staring at her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell!‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Why‚M-^@M-^Twhy‚M-^@M-^TI never think of$
+money like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why should you?‚M-^@M-^] said the woman roughly, as she flung the package on$
+the table. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been after money in quantities like that all my life.$
+It has always been dangling in front of me and eluding me‚M-^@M-^Teluding is$
+the word, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are all those pictures?‚M-^@M-^] she changed the subject abruptly,$
+pointing to the framed photographs which covered the walls. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+photographs of India, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John was born in Morocco and lived there$
+until he went to school. He speaks Arabic like a native. Did you know$
+that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys strange. Morocco!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know it?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been there‚M-^@M-^Tonce,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\Did Sir John go$
+often?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before he married, yes,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary. ‚M-^@M-^\He had large interests there at$
+one time, I think.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John came back at that moment, and Mary noticed that his first$
+glance was at the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, they‚M-^@M-^Yve found nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\neither footprints nor the$
+empty shell. They‚M-^@M-^Yre making a search of the grounds to-morrow. Lebbitter$
+wanted to post a man to protect the house in view of the other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What other matter?‚M-^@M-^] asked his wife quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\nothing really which concerns you. Of course,$
+I would not allow the police to do that. It would make the house more$
+conspicuous than it is at present.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at the two.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now,‚M-^@M-^] he said bluntly, ‚M-^@M-^\I think you had better go off to bed. I have$
+still a lot of work to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His wife obeyed without a word, and the girl was following her, when he$
+called her back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+the best man that ever lived, but I‚M-^@M-^Yve tried to make you happy, my dear,$
+in my own way. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been as a daughter to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked up at him with shining eyes. She could not trust herself to$
+speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Things haven‚M-^@M-^Yt gone as well as they might during the past year,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I made a colossal blunder, but I made it with my eyes open. It$
+hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt been pleasant for either of us, but there‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+regretting what you cannot mend. Mary, they tell me that you‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+seeing a lot of this young man Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was annoyed to find herself going red when there was really no$
+reason for it. She need not ask who ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^] were, she could guess.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been making inquiries about that boy,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+I can tell you this, he is straight. Perhaps he has led an$
+unconventional life, but all that he told Sadie was true. He‚M-^@M-^Ys clean,$
+and, Mary, that counts for something in this world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He seemed at a loss how to proceed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anything might happen,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Although I‚M-^@M-^Ym not an old man, I$
+have enemies. . . .‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have many enemies,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Some of them are hateful, and I want to$
+tell you this, that if trouble ever comes and that boy is within$
+call‚M-^@M-^Tgo to him. I know men, good, bad and indifferent; he‚M-^@M-^Ys neither bad$
+nor indifferent. And now, good night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He kissed her on the forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You needn‚M-^@M-^Yt tell your aunt what I‚M-^@M-^Yve been talking about,‚M-^@M-^] he said at$
+parting and led her to the door, closing and locking it behind her.$
+$
+He sat down in his chair for a very long time before he made a move,$
+then he began picking up the packages and carrying them to the safe. He$
+stopped half-way through and resumed his seat in the chair, waiting for$
+the hour to pass, by which time he judged the household would be asleep.$
+$
+At midnight he took a pair of rubber boots from a locker, pulled them$
+on, and went out through the door leading to the balcony, down the$
+covered stairway to the garden. Unerringly he walked across the lawn to$
+a corner of his grounds which his gardeners had never attempted to$
+cultivate. He stopped once and groped about in the bushes for a spade$
+which he had carefully planted there a few nights before. His hand$
+touched the rotting wood of an older spade and he smiled. For six years$
+the tool had remained where he had put it the last time he had visited$
+this No-Man‚M-^@M-^Ys-Land.$
+$
+Presently he came to a little hillock and began digging. The soil was$
+soft, and he had not gone far before the spade struck wood. He cleared a$
+space two feet square and drew from the earth a small crescent of wood.$
+It was, in fact, a part of the wooden cover of a well which had long$
+since gone dry but which had been covered up by its previous owner and$
+again covered by Maxell.$
+$
+Lying at full length on the ground, he reached down through the$
+aperture, and his fingers found a big rusty nail on which was suspended$
+a length of piano wire. At the end of the wire was attached a small$
+leather bag and this he drew up and unfastened, and putting the bag on$
+one side, let the free end of the wire fall into the well.$
+$
+He replaced the wood, covered it again with earth, all the time$
+exercising care, for, small as the aperture was, it was big enough for$
+even a man of his size to slip through.$
+$
+A cloaked figure which stood in the shadow of the bushes watching him,$
+which had followed him as noiselessly across the lawn, saw him lift the$
+bag and take it back to the house and disappear through the covered$
+stairway. So still a night it was, that the watcher could hear the click$
+of the lower door as Sir John locked it, and the soft pad of his feet as$
+they mounted the stairs.$

+$
+$
+MR. GOLDBERG, the manager and proprietor of the Parade Drug Store, was$
+a man who possessed neither a sense of imagination nor the spirit of$
+romance. He sent peremptorily for Timothy, and Timothy came with a$
+feeling that all was not well.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said Goldberg in his best magisterial manner, ‚M-^@M-^\I took$
+you into my shop because I was short of a man and because I understood$
+that you had had some business experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business experience,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy carefully, ‚M-^@M-^\of a kind.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I gave you particular instructions,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\on$
+one very vital point. We carry a full line of all the best proprietorial$
+medicines, and our customers can always get them upon application. Each$
+of those medicines we duplicate, as you know, providing the same$
+constituents and charging some sixpence to a shilling less‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, we$
+are out to save the public from being robbed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understand you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I don‚M-^@M-^Yt see much difference$
+between robbing the public and robbing the patent medicine proprietors,$
+and all that just-as-good stuff never did impress me, anyway. It stands$
+to reason,‚M-^@M-^] he said, leaning over the desk and speaking with the$
+earnestness of a crusader, ‚M-^@M-^\that the advertised article must be more$
+even in quality and it must be good all round. You can‚M-^@M-^Yt advertise a bad$
+article and get away with it, except on the first sale, and that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+pay the advertiser. The goods sell the goods, and the advertisement is$
+only to make you take the first lick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I do not want a lecture on advertising or on commercial morality,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Mr. Goldberg with ominous calm. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely want to tell you that you were$
+overheard by my chief assistant telling a customer not to ‚M-^@M-^Xtake a$
+chance‚M-^@M-^Y on one of my own pills.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys right,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, nodding his head vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Guilty, my$
+lord. What about it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have had a further complaint,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg, consulting with$
+elaborate ceremony a little notebook. ‚M-^@M-^\I understand that you have$
+initiated the awful practice of offering to toss customers for their$
+change. People have written me strong letters of complaint about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because they lost,‚M-^@M-^] said the indignant Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\what‚M-^@M-^Ys wrong about$
+that, anyway, Mr. Goldberg? I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pocket the money, and I win twice$
+out of every three times. If a fellow likes to take a chance as to$
+whether he gets sixpence or we get a shilling, why worry?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The outraged Mr. Goldberg brindled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sort of thing may be all right at a country fair or even in a$
+country shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not good enough for the Parade Drug$
+Store, Bournemouth, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll dispense with your services as from this$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre losing a good man,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, but Mr. Goldberg did$
+not seem to take that loss to heart.$
+$
+All ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] jobs ended violently. He never conceived$
+of them ending in any other way, and invariably regarded the sum of$
+money which was received in lieu of notice, or as compensation for$
+breach of contract, as being something in the nature of a nest-egg which$
+a kindly Providence had foreordained, and he was neither cast down nor$
+elated by the crisis in his affairs when, by a fortunate accident, he$
+met Mary Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tthe fortune was apparent, but the accident belonged to$
+the category which determined the hour at which trains leave stations.$
+$
+Hitherto, on the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys part, these meetings had been fraught with a$
+certain amount of apprehension, if not terror. They had begun when$
+Timothy had stopped her on the morning after his quarrel with Lady$
+Maxell, and had made bland inquiries as to that lady‚M-^@M-^Ys condition. Then$
+she had been in a panic and frantically anxious to end the interview,$
+and it required all her self-restraint to prevent her flying at top$
+speed from this wicked young man who had been so abominably rude.$
+$
+At their second meeting he had greeted her as an old friend, and she had$
+left him with the illusion of a life-time acquaintance. Hereafter$
+matters went smoothly, and they went so because Timothy Anderson was$
+unlike any of the other boys she had ever met.$
+$
+He paid her no compliments, he did not grow sentimental, he neither$
+tried to hold her hand nor kiss her, nor was he ever oppressed by that$
+overwhelming melancholy which is the heritage and pride of youth.$
+$
+Not once did he hint at an early decline or the possibility of his going$
+away to die in far lands. Instead he kept her in screams of laughter at$
+his interpretation of movie plays in the making. He did not ask for a$
+keepsake; the only request he made of her in this direction was one$
+which first took her breath away. Thereafter she never met him unless$
+she had in the bag which slung from her wrist one small box of matches;$
+for ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson had never possessed or carried the means of$
+ignition for his cigarette for one whole hour together.$
+$
+Timothy told her most of what the proprietor of the Parade Drug Store$
+had told him. The girl thought it was a joke, because that was exactly$
+the way Timothy presented the matter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you won‚M-^@M-^Yt be going away soon?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not till I go abroad,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy calmly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going abroad too?‚M-^@M-^] she asked in surprise.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to Paris and Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^Tespecially to Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\and afterwards I may run across to Algeria or to Egypt.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him with a new respect. She was less impressed by the$
+great possessions which his plans betrayed than by his confident$
+independence, and dimly she wondered why he was working at a drug-store$
+for low wages and wondered, too, whether he was‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you blushing about?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt blushing,‚M-^@M-^] she protested; ‚M-^@M-^\I was just wondering whether I$
+could ever afford a trip like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you can,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\If I can afford it,$
+you can, can‚M-^@M-^Yt you? If I go abroad and stay at the best hotels, and go$
+joy rides in the Alps and plan all this when I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got fifteen$
+shillings over my rent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt fifteen shillings over your rent!‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, aghast.$
+‚M-^@M-^\But how can you go abroad without money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was genuinely astounded that she could ask so absurd a question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\A little thing like money$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt really count.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre very silly,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, there was something I wanted$
+to tell you, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may call me Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to call you Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she replied.$
+$
+He shook his head with a pained expression.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Yll be ever so much more sociable if you call me Timothy and I call$
+you Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We can be very sociable without that familiarity,‚M-^@M-^] she said severely.$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was just going to tell you something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They sat on the grass together, on the shadow fringe of a big oak and$
+the spring sunshine wove its restless arabesques on her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\that last night I had two queer$
+experiences and I was scared; oh, scared to death!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eating things at night,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy oracularly, ‚M-^@M-^\especially before$
+you go to bed‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt dreaming,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly, ‚M-^@M-^\nor was it a nightmare. I$
+won‚M-^@M-^Yt tell you if you‚M-^@M-^Yre so horrid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym only speaking as an ex-chemist and druggist,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gravely;$
+‚M-^@M-^\but please forgive me. Tell me what it is, Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Mary Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he compromised.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\First I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the least worst,‚M-^@M-^] she began. ‚M-^@M-^\It happened about one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the morning. I had gone to bed awfully tired, but somehow I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt sleep, so I got up and walked about the room. I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt like$
+putting on the light because that meant drawing down the blinds which I$
+had let up when I went to bed, and the blinds make such a noise that I$
+thought the whole of the house would hear. So I put on my dressing-gown$
+and sat by the window. It was rather chilly, but my wrap was warm, and$
+sitting there I dozed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know how long, but it was nearly an hour,$
+I think. When I woke up I saw a man right in the centre of the lawn.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What sort of a man?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is the peculiar thing about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt a white$
+man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A coon?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I think it must have been a Moor. He wore a long white dress that$
+reached down to his ankles, and over that he had a big, heavy black$
+cloak.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He went round the corner of the house towards uncle‚M-^@M-^Ys private stairway$
+and he was gone quite a long time. My first thought was to awaken uncle$
+and tell him, but then I remembered that Sir John had spent a long time$
+in Morocco and possibly he knew that the man was about the house. You$
+see, we have had Moorish visitors before, when ships have come to Poole.$
+Once we had a very important man, a Kaid, and Sir John made queer tea$
+for him in glasses with mint and stuff. So I just didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what to$
+do. Whilst I was wondering whether I ought not at least to wake Lady$
+Maxell, he reappeared, walked across the lawn and went down the path$
+which leads to the back entrance‚M-^@M-^Tyou‚M-^@M-^Yre laughing at me,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you mistake for a laugh,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\is merely one$
+large smile of pleasure at being in your confidence.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was in two minds as to whether she would be angry or pleased, but$
+his tone changed to a more serious one.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like the idea of the gaudy East wandering loose under your$
+bedroom window in the middle of the night,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell Lady$
+Maxell this morning?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, she was up very early and has been out all day. I have not seen$
+her‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, she was not at breakfast. Now I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the really$
+serious thing that happened, and I do hope, Mr. Anderson, that you won‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+be flippant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Trust me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl had no reason to complain of his attitude when she had$
+described the shooting incident. He was aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is terrible!‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, it might have hit you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it might have hit me,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+whole point of my story, so far as you are concerned‚M-^@M-^TI mean, so far as$
+I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she added hastily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So fax as I am concerned too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\I just hate the$
+idea of anything even frightening you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She rose hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am going to shop now,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the hurry?‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ignoring his question, ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you to$
+think that uncle is feeling badly about you because of what has happened$
+in the house. He spoke to me of you last night, and he spoke very$
+nicely. I am worried to death about Sir John. He has made enemies in his$
+life, and I am sure that this shooting affair is the sequel to some old$
+feud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should say that is so,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He looked down at the grass very thoughtfully and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll go home,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I had better sleep this afternoon if I$
+am to be up all night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Up all night?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\What is happening? Is there a$
+ball or something?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will be something livelier than a ball,‚M-^@M-^] he said grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if I$
+find anybody in your garden to-night. And Miss Maxell, if you look out$
+of your window and you see a solitary figure on sentry-go don‚M-^@M-^Yt shoot,$
+because it will be me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] she gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt do it, Mr. Anderson. Uncle$
+would be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped her with a gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Possibly nobody will come to-night,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and as likely as not I$
+shall be pinched by the police as a suspicious character. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+chance that somebody will come, and that‚M-^@M-^Ys the chance I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to$
+take.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XII$
+$
+$
+TRUE to his word, he returned to his lodgings and spent the afternoon$
+in slumber. He had the gift which all great men possess, of being able$
+to sleep at will. He was staying at a boarding-house, and occupied a$
+room which had originally been a side veranda, but had been walled in$
+and converted into an extra bedroom. It was a remarkably convenient room$
+for him, as he had discovered on previous occasions. He had but to open$
+the window and drop on to the grass to make his exit without anybody in$
+the house being the wiser. More to the point, he could return at any$
+hour by the same route without disturbing the household.$
+$
+He had his supper, and whilst it was still very light he went out to$
+reconnoitre Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys demesne. He was able to make the circuit of the$
+house, which occupied a corner site and was isolated by two lanes, and$
+he saw nobody until, returning to the front of the house, a car drove up$
+and a woman alighted.$
+$
+He had no difficulty in recognising Lady Maxell, but the taxi interested$
+him more than the lady. It was smothered with mud and had evidently come$
+a long journey.$
+$
+As evidently she had hired it in some distant town and she had not as$
+yet finished with it, because she gave the man some directions and$
+money, and from the profound respect which the chauffeur showed, it was$
+clear that that money was merely a tip.$
+$
+Timothy stood where he could clearly be seen, but her back was toward$
+him all the time and she did not so much as glance in his direction when$
+she passed through the gate and up the garden path.$
+$
+It was curious, thought Timothy, that she did not take the car up the$
+drive to the house. More curious was it that she should, at this late$
+hour of the evening, have further use for it.$
+$
+He returned to his room, full of theories, the majority of which were$
+wholly wild and improbable. He lay on his bed, indulging in those dreams$
+which made up the happiest part of his life. Of late he had taken a new$
+and a more radiant pattern to the web of his fancy and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, fiddlesticks!‚M-^@M-^] he said in disgust, rolling over and sitting up with$
+a yawn.$
+$
+He heard the feet of the boarders on the gravel path outside, and once$
+he heard a girl say evidently to a visitor:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you see that funny room! That is Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was still an hour or so to be passed, and he joined the party in$
+the parlour so restless and distrait as to attract attention and a$
+little mild raillery from his fellow guests. He went back to his room,$
+turned on the light and pulled a trunk from under the bed.$
+$
+Somehow his mind had been running all day upon that erring cousin whose$
+name he bore and whose disappearance from public life was such a$
+mystery. Possibly it was Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys words which had brought Alfred$
+Cartwright to his mind. His mother had left him a number of family$
+documents, which, with the indolence of youth, he had never examined$
+very closely. He had the impression that they consisted in the main of$
+receipts, old diplomas of his father‚M-^@M-^Ys (who was an engineer) and sundry$
+other family documents which were not calculated to excite the curiosity$
+of the adventurous youth.$
+$
+He took out the two big envelopes in which these papers were kept and$
+turned them on to the bed, examining them one by one. Why his cousin$
+should be in his mind, why he should have taken this action at that$
+particular moment, the psychologist and the psychical expert alone can$
+explain. They may produce in explanation such esoteric phenomena as$
+auras, influences, and telepathies, and perhaps they are right.$
+$
+He had not searched long before he came upon a small package of$
+newspaper cuttings, bound about by a rubber band. He read them at first$
+without interest, and then without comprehension. There was one cutting,$
+however, which had been clipped from its context, which seemed to tell$
+the whole story of the rest. It ran:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\When Cartwright stood up for sentence he did not seem to be$
+    greatly troubled by his serious position. As the words ‚M-^@M-^Xtwenty$
+    years‚M-^@M-^Y passed Mr. Justice Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips, he fell back as if he$
+    had been shot. Then, springing to the edge of the dock, he$
+    hurled an epithet at his lordship. Some of his business$
+    associates suggest that the learned judge was a partner of$
+    Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^Tan astonishing and most improper suggestion to$
+    make. In view of the statement that the prisoner made before the$
+    trial, when suggestions had been made in a newspaper that the$
+    judge had been connected with him in business years before, and$
+    remembering that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys statement was to the effect that$
+    he had had no business transactions with the judge, it seems as$
+    though the outburst was made in a fit of spleen at the severity$
+    of the sentence. Sir John Maxell, after the case, took the$
+    unusual step of informing a Press representative that he$
+    intended placing his affairs in the hands of a committee for$
+    investigation, and had invited the Attorney-General to appoint$
+    that committee. ‚M-^@M-^XI insist upon this being done,‚M-^@M-^Y he said,$
+    ‚M-^@M-^Xbecause after the prisoner‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation I should not feel$
+    comfortable until an impartial committee had examined my$
+    affairs.‚M-^@M-^Y It is understood that after the investigation the$
+    learned judge intends retiring from the Bench.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy gasped. So that was the explanation. That was why Maxell had$
+written to him, that was why he made no reference at all to his father,$
+but to this disreputable cousin of his. Slowly he returned the package$
+to its envelope, dropped it into his trunk and pushed the trunk under$
+the bed.$
+$
+And that was the secret of Cousin Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys disappearance. He might$
+have guessed it; he might even have known had he troubled to look at$
+these papers.$
+$
+He sat on the bed, his hands clasping his knees. It was not a pleasant$
+reflection that he had a relative, and a relative moreover after whom he$
+was named, serving what might be a life sentence in a convict$
+establishment. But what made him think of the matter to-night?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson! Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round with a start. The man whose face was framed in the$
+open window might have been forty, fifty or sixty. It was a face heavily$
+seamed and sparsely bearded‚M-^@M-^Ta hollow-eyed, hungry face, but those eyes$
+burnt like fire. Timothy jumped up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Who are you ‚M-^@M-^XTimothying‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] the man laughed unpleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Can I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, you can come in,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He wondered what old acquaintance this was who had come to the tramp$
+level, and rapidly turned over in his mind all the possible candidates$
+for trampdom he had met.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the man again. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yve tracked you$
+here, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve been sitting in those bushes for two hours. I heard one$
+of the boarders say that it was your window and I waited till it was$
+dark before I came out.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All this is highly interesting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, surveying the shrunken$
+figure without enthusiasm, ‚M-^@M-^\but who are you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had a provisional pardon,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and they put me in a$
+sanatorium‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Yve something the matter with one of my lungs. It was$
+always a trouble to me. I was supposed to stay in the sanatorium‚M-^@M-^Tthat$
+was one of the terms on which I was pardoned‚M-^@M-^Tbut I escaped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy stared at him with open mouth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alfred Cartwright!‚M-^@M-^] he breathed.$
+$
+The man nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys me,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Timothy looked down at the edge of the black box.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that is why I was thinking about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, this beats$
+all! Sit down, won‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pulled a chair up for his visitor and again gazed on him with$
+curiosity but without affection. Something in Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys attitude annoyed$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not glad to see me?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not very,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\The truth is, you‚M-^@M-^Yve only just come into$
+existence so far as I am concerned. I thought you were dead.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not until a few minutes ago. I was reading the cuttings about your$
+trial‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that was what you were reading?‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to see ‚M-^@M-^Yem$
+one of these days. Do you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve come for?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was only at that moment that Sir John flashed through Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys mind.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I guess what you‚M-^@M-^Yve come after,‚M-^@M-^] he said slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre here to see$
+Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym here to see Mister Justice Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man between his teeth.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took the stump of a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lit it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\John Maxell and I have a score to settle, and it is going to be settled$
+very soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tide and weather permitting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy flippantly, recovering his$
+self-possession. ‚M-^@M-^\All that vendetta stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt go, Mr. Cartwright.‚M-^@M-^]$
+Then he asked in a flash: ‚M-^@M-^\Did you shoot at him last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise was a convincing reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shoot at him? I only got to this place this afternoon. It‚M-^@M-^Ys more likely$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys waiting to shoot at me, for the sanatorium people will have$
+telegraphed to him the moment I was missing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy walked to the window and pulled down the blinds.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now tell me, Mr. Cartwright, before we go any farther, do you still$
+persist in the story you told the court, that the judge was a party to$
+your swindle?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A party to it!‚M-^@M-^] said the other man furiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course he was! I was$
+using the money of my companies to buy concessions from the Moorish$
+Government, as much on his behalf as on mine. He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt in the Brigot$
+swindle‚M-^@M-^Tbut he held shares in the company I was financing. We located a$
+gold mine in the Angera country, and Maxell and I went across to Europe$
+every year regularly to look after our property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We had to keep it quiet because we secured the concessions from the$
+Pretender, knowing that he‚M-^@M-^Yd put the Sultan out of business the moment$
+he got busy. If it had been known, the Sultan would have repudiated the$
+concession, and our Government would have upheld the repudiation. Maxell$
+speaks the language like a native, and I learnt enough to get on with El$
+Mograb, who is the biggest thing amongst the rebel tribes. El Mograb$
+wanted us to stay there, Maxell and I; he‚M-^@M-^Yd have made us shereefs or$
+pashas, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd have done it, because I knew there was going to be an$
+investigation sooner or later into the affairs of my companies. But$
+Maxell wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have it. He always pretended that, so far as he knew, my$
+financing was straight. You know the rest,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\When I came before$
+Maxell, I thought I was safe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John allowed his affairs to be inspected,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\If he$
+had been engaged with you in this Morocco business, there must have been$
+papers to prove it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed harshly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course he‚M-^@M-^Yd allow his affairs to be investigated,‚M-^@M-^] he sneered. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you think that old fox couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt _cache_ all the documents that put him$
+wrong? Papers? Why, he must have enough papers to hang him, if you could$
+only find ‚M-^@M-^Yem!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+There was one thing he was determined that this man should _not_ do, and$
+that was to disturb the peace of mind, not of Sir John Maxell or his$
+wife, but of a certain goddess whose bedroom overlooked the lawn.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What am I going to do?‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going up to get$
+my share. And he‚M-^@M-^Yll be lucky if that‚M-^@M-^Ys all he loses. One of the mines$
+was sold to a syndicate last year‚M-^@M-^TI had news of it in gaol. He didn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+get much for it because he was in a hurry to sell‚M-^@M-^TI suppose his other$
+investments must have been going wrong twelve months ago‚M-^@M-^Tbut I want my$
+share of that!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you had best see Sir John in the morning. I will arrange an$
+interview.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the morning!‚M-^@M-^] said the other contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose you make the$
+arrangement, what would happen? When I went up there I should find a$
+couple of cops waiting to pinch me. I know John! I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and the man stared at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You think not?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\What has it to do with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite a lot,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely state that you will not see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright stroked his bristly chin undecidedly and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, well,‚M-^@M-^] he said in a milder tone, ‚M-^@M-^\maybe you can fix things up for$
+me in the morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you sleeping to-night?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had money, a little; and he had arranged to sleep at the house of a$
+man he had known in better times. Timothy accompanied him through the$
+window and into the street, and walked with him to the end of the road.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If my gamble had come off, you‚M-^@M-^Yd have benefited, Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+man unexpectedly, breaking in upon another topic which they were$
+discussing.$
+$
+They parted, and Timothy watched him out of sight, then turned on and$
+walked in the opposite direction, to take up his self-imposed vigil.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIII$
+$
+$
+THERE was something in the air that was electrical, and Mary Maxell$
+felt it as she sat at supper with Sir John and his wife. Maxell was$
+unusually silent and his wife amazingly so. She was nervous and almost$
+jumped when a remark was addressed to her. The old truculence which$
+distinguished her every word and action, her readiness to take offence,$
+to see a slight in the most innocent remark, and her combativeness$
+generally, had disappeared; she was almost meek when she replied to her$
+husband‚M-^@M-^Ys questions.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just went round shopping and then decided to call on a girl I had$
+known a long time ago. She lives in the country, and I felt so nervous$
+and depressed this morning that I thought a ride in a taxi would do me$
+good.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you take our car?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt decide until the last moment to go out to her, and then I went$
+by train one way.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad you went into the fresh air,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it will do you good.$
+The country is not so beautiful as Honolulu, but it is not without its$
+attractions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was unusual for the Judge to be sarcastic, but it was less usual for$
+Lady Maxell to accept sarcasm without a retort. To Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise she$
+made no reply, though a faint smile curved those straight lips of hers$
+for a second.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it was a burglar last night?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good heavens, no!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\Burglars do not shoot up the house$
+they burgle.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it is safe to have all this money in the house?‚M-^@M-^] she$
+asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly safe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that need alarm you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+No further reference was made to the matter, and presently Sir John went$
+up to his study. Mrs. Maxell did not go to the parlour, but drew a chair$
+to the fire in the dining-room and read, and the girl followed her$
+example. Presently the elder woman left the room and was gone a quarter$
+of an hour before she returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, so sweetly that the girl was startled, ‚M-^@M-^\such an$
+annoying thing has happened‚M-^@M-^TI have lost the key of my wardrobe. You$
+borrowed one of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicates the other day‚M-^@M-^Twhere did you put$
+the ring?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+John Maxell was a methodical and systematic man. He had a duplicate set$
+of all the keys in the house, and these as a rule were kept in a small$
+wall-safe in his own bedroom. He had never invited his wife to use that$
+receptacle, but she had a shrewd idea that the combination which was$
+denied to her had been given to the girl.$
+$
+Mary hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think if you asked Uncle‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the lady, ‚M-^@M-^\if I went to him now, he‚M-^@M-^Yd never forgive$
+me. If you know where the keys are, be an angel and get them for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl rose, and Lady Maxell followed her upstairs. Her own room was$
+next to her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys and communicated, but the door was invariably$
+locked on Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys side. Presently the girl came in to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here they are,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Please let me put them back quickly. I feel$
+very guilty at having taken them at all without his permission.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And for goodness‚M-^@M-^Y sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt tell him,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, examining the$
+keys.$
+$
+At last she found the one she wanted, but was a long time in the$
+process. She opened her bureau and the girl took the big key-ring from$
+her hand with such evident relief that Lady Maxell laughed.$
+$
+It had been easier than she thought and unless she made a blunder, the$
+key she had selected from the bunch while she was fumbling at the$
+bureau, would make just the difference‚M-^@M-^Tjust the difference.$
+$
+It was not customary for Sir John to come down from his study to enjoy$
+the ladies‚M-^@M-^Y company after dinner, but on this evening he made an$
+exception to his rule. He found his wife and ward reading, one on each$
+side of the fireplace. Lady Maxell looked up when her husband came in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a curious story, John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think it must be an$
+American story, about a woman who robbed her husband and the police$
+refused to arrest her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing curious about that,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\in law a wife$
+cannot rob her husband or a husband his wife.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that if you came to my Honolulu estate and stole my pearls,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said banteringly, ‚M-^@M-^\I could not have you arrested.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except for walking in my sleep!‚M-^@M-^] he said smilingly, and they both$
+laughed together.$
+$
+He had never seen her so amiable, and for the first time that day‚M-^@M-^Tit$
+had been a very trying and momentous day‚M-^@M-^The had his misgivings. She,$
+with the memory of her good day‚M-^@M-^Ys work, the excellent terms she had$
+arranged with the skipper of the _Lord Lawrence_, due to leave$
+Southampton for Cadiz at daylight the next morning, had no misgivings at$
+all, especially when she thought of a key she had placed under her$
+pillow. She had had the choice of two boats, the _Lord Lawrence_ and the$
+_Saffi_, but the _Saffi‚M-^@M-^Ys_ voyage would have been a long one, and its$
+port of destination might hold discomfort which she had no wish to$
+experience.$
+$
+The household retired at eleven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock, and it was past midnight before$
+Sadie Maxell heard her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys door close, and half an hour later$
+before the click of the switch told her that his light had been$
+extinguished.$
+$
+He was a ready sleeper, but she gave him yet another half-hour before$
+she opened the door of her bedroom and stepped out into the black$
+corridor. She moved noiselessly towards the study, her only fear being$
+that the baronet had locked the door before he came out. But this fear$
+was not well founded, and the door yielded readily to her touch. She was$
+dressed, and carried only a small attach√© case filled with the bare$
+necessities for the voyage.$
+$
+She pushed the catch of her electric lamp, located the safe and opened$
+it with no difficulty. She found herself surprisingly short of breath,$
+and her heart beat at such a furious rate that she thought it must be$
+audible to everybody in the house. The envelope with the money lay at$
+the bottom of the others, and she transferred its contents to her$
+attach√© case in a few seconds.$
+$
+Then her heart stood still. . . .$
+$
+It was only the faintest creak she heard, but it came from a corner of$
+the room where the door leading to the cupboard stairway was placed. She$
+saw a faint grey line of light appear‚M-^@M-^Tthe stairway had a glass roof and$
+admitted enough light to show her that the door was slowly opening. She$
+had to bite her lips to stop herself from screaming. To make her escape$
+or to rouse Sir John was impossible, and she opened the attach√© case$
+again, and with trembling fingers felt for the little revolver which she$
+had taken from her drawer. She felt safer now, yet she had not the$
+courage to switch on the light.$
+$
+She saw the figure of a man silhouetted in the opening, then the door$
+closed, and her terror bred of itself a certain courage.$
+$
+She flashed the light full on his face. The dead silence was broken when$
+she whispered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, God! Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who‚M-^@M-^Ys that?‚M-^@M-^] he whispered, and snatched the torch from her hand.$
+$
+He looked at her long and curiously, and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I expected to find that Maxell had taken most of my possessions,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I never thought he would take my wife!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us see what all this is about,‚M-^@M-^] boomed the big voice of John Maxell$
+almost in the man‚M-^@M-^Ys ear, he was so close, and suddenly the room was$
+flooded with light.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIV$
+$
+$
+THE self-appointed watcher found time pass very slowly. Twelve and one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock struck from a distant church, but there was no sign of midnight$
+assassins, and the house, looking very solemn and quiet in the light of$
+a waning moon, irritated and annoyed him. From the roadway where he$
+paced silently to and fro‚M-^@M-^The had taken the precaution of wearing a pair$
+of rubber-soled shoes‚M-^@M-^The could glimpse Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys window, and once he$
+thought he saw her looking out.$
+$
+He made a point of walking entirely round the house twice in every hour,$
+and it was on one of these excursions that he heard a sound which$
+brought him to a standstill. It was a sound like two pieces of flat$
+board being smacked together sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tap . . . tap!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and listened, but heard nothing further. Then he retraced his$
+footsteps to the front of the house and waited, but there was no sound$
+or sign. Another half-hour passed, and then a patrolling policeman came$
+along on the other side of the roadway. At the sight of the young man he$
+crossed the road, and Jim recognised an acquaintance of his drug-store$
+days. Nothing was to be gained by being evasive or mysterious, and$
+Timothy told the policeman frankly his object.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I heard about the shooting last night,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and the$
+inspector offered to put one of our men on duty here, but Sir John$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt hear of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took a professional look at the house, and pointed to its dark upper$
+windows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That house is asleep‚M-^@M-^Tyou needn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about that,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\besides,$
+it‚M-^@M-^Yll be daylight in two hours, and a burglar wants that time to get$
+home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy paused irresolutely. It seemed absurd to wait any longer, and$
+besides, to be consistent he must be prepared to adopt this watchman$
+r√¥le every night.$
+$
+There was no particular reason why Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy should choose$
+this night or any other. He had half expected to see Cartwright and was$
+agreeably disappointed that he did not loom into view.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre right,‚M-^@M-^] he said to the policeman. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll walk along down$
+the road with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They must have walked a quarter of a mile, and were standing chatting at$
+the corner of the street, when a sound, borne clearly on the night air,$
+made both men look back in the direction whence they had come. They saw$
+two glaring spots of light somewhere in the vicinity of the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+house.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a car,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, ‚M-^@M-^\what is it doing there at this time$
+of the morning? There is nobody sick in the house, is there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head. Already he had begun to walk back, and the$
+policeman, sensing something wrong, kept him company. They had covered$
+half the distance which separated them from the car, when it began to$
+move toward them, gathering speed. It flashed past and Timothy saw$
+nothing save the driver, for the hood was raised and its canvas blinds$
+hid whatever passenger it carried.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It came in from the other end of the avenue,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman$
+unnecessarily. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe Sir John is going a long journey and is starting$
+early.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell would have told me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, troubled. ‚M-^@M-^\I nearly took$
+a chance and made a jump for that car.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was one of the few chances Timothy did not take, and one that he$
+bitterly regretted afterwards.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical policeman, ‚M-^@M-^\I should have been looking$
+for the ambulance for you now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was no longer satisfied to play the r√¥le of the silent watcher.$
+When he came to the house he went boldly through the gate and up the$
+drive, and his warrant for the intrusion was the officer who followed$
+him. It was then that he saw the open window of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys room, and his$
+heart leapt into his mouth. He quickened his step, but just as he came$
+under the window, she appeared, and Timothy sighed his relief.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is that you?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a low worried voice; ‚M-^@M-^\is that Mr. Anderson?$
+Thank heaven you‚M-^@M-^Yve come! Wait, I will come down and open the door for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked to the entrance, and presently the door was opened and the$
+girl, dressed in a wrapper, appeared. She tried to keep her voice$
+steady, but the strain of the past half-hour had been too much for her,$
+and she was on the verge of tears when Timothy put his arm about her$
+shaking shoulders and forced her down into a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and tell us what has happened.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at the officer and tried to speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a servant,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman; ‚M-^@M-^\perhaps he knows something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A man dressed in shirt and trousers was coming down the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can‚M-^@M-^Yt make him hear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\or Lady Maxell, either.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know, sir. The young lady woke me and asked me to rouse Sir$
+John.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sorry I am so silly. I am probably$
+making a lot of trouble over nothing. It happened nearly an hour ago, I$
+was asleep and I heard a sound; thought I was dreaming of what happened$
+last night. It sounded like two shots, but, whatever it was, it woke$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know. I thought I heard them too,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you were out there all the time?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and put out her hand$
+to him.$
+$
+For that look she gave him Timothy would have stayed out the three$
+hundred and sixty-five nights in the year.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I lay for a very long time, thinking that the sound would wake my$
+uncle, but I heard nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is your room near Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys?‚M-^@M-^] asked the policeman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, mine is on this side of the building; Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+sleep on the other side. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what it was, but something alarmed$
+me and filled me with terror‚M-^@M-^Tsomething that made my flesh go rough and$
+cold‚M-^@M-^Toh, it was horrible!‚M-^@M-^] she shuddered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt endure it any longer, so I got out of bed and went out into$
+the corridor to wake uncle. Just then I heard a sound outside my window,$
+but I was just too terrified to look out. Then I heard a motor-car and$
+footsteps on the path outside. I went to Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys door and knocked,$
+but got no answer. Then I tried Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys door, but there was no$
+answer there either. So I went to Johnson‚M-^@M-^Ys room and woke him;‚M-^@M-^] she$
+looked at Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Tthought that you might be there, so I came$
+back to the open window and looked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Show me Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman to the servant, and the$
+three men passed up the stairs, followed by the girl.$
+$
+The door which the man indicated was locked, and even when the policeman$
+hammered on the panel there was no response.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think the key of my door will unlock almost any of the room doors,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the girl suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John told me once that all the room locks$
+were made on the same plan.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She went away and came back with a key. The policeman fitted it in the$
+lock and opened the door, feeling for and finding the electric switch as$
+he entered. The room was empty, and apparently the bed had not been$
+occupied.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where does that door lead?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That leads to Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\there is a key on$
+this side.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This door he found was open and again they found an empty room and a bed$
+which had not been slept in. They looked at one another.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Sir John be in his study till late?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is at the end of the corridor,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a broken voice, for she$
+felt that the study held some dreadful secret.$
+$
+This door was locked too, locked from the inside. By now the policeman$
+was standing on no ceremony, and with a quick thrust of his shoulder he$
+broke the lock, and the door flew open.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us have a little light,‚M-^@M-^] he said, unconsciously copying words which$
+had been spoken in that room an hour before.$
+$
+The room was empty, but here at any rate was evidence. The safe stood$
+open, the fireplace was filled with glowing ashes, and the air of the$
+room was pungent with the scent of burnt paper.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is this?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy, pointing to the ground.$
+$
+The floor of the study was covered with a thick, biscuit-coloured$
+carpet, and ‚M-^@M-^\this‚M-^@M-^] was a round, dark stain which was still wet. The$
+policeman went on his knees and examined it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is blood,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly; ‚M-^@M-^\there‚M-^@M-^Ys another patch near the door.$
+Where does this door lead? Catch that girl, she‚M-^@M-^Ys fainting!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was just in time to slip his arm round Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys waist before she$
+collapsed. By this time the household was aroused, and a woman servant$
+was on the spot to take charge of Mary. When Timothy had rejoined the$
+policeman, that officer had discovered where the door led.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You go down a stairway into the garden,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It looks as if two$
+shots were fired here. Look, there‚M-^@M-^Ys the mark of both of them on the$
+wall.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you suggest that two people have been killed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The policeman nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\One was shot in the middle of the room, and one was probably shot on$
+the way to the door. What do you make of this?‚M-^@M-^] and he held up a bag,$
+discoloured and weather-worn, with a handle to which was fastened a long$
+length of rusty wire.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is empty,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, examining the contents of the little$
+grip which, up till an hour before, had held John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys most$
+jealously guarded secrets.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll use this ‚M-^@M-^Yphone,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better stay by, Mr.$
+Anderson. We shall want your evidence‚M-^@M-^Tit will be important. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+often we have a man watching outside a house where a murder is$
+committed‚M-^@M-^Tprobably two.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The sun had risen before the preliminary interrogation and the search of$
+the house and grounds had been concluded. Blewitt the detective, who had$
+taken charge of the case, came into the dining-room, where a worried$
+servant was serving coffee for the investigators, and dropped down on to$
+a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue and there‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue alone,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and drew from$
+his pocket a soft hat. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you recognise this, Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that was worn last night by the man I spoke to you$
+about.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I could swear to it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Where did you find it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Outside,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective; ‚M-^@M-^\and that is all we have to go on. There$
+is no sign of any body. My first theory stands.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You believe that the murderer carried Sir John and Lady Maxell into the$
+car and drove away with them?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\but that pre-supposes that$
+the chauffeur was in the plot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He may have been and he may have been terrorised,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Even a taxi-driver will be obliging if you stick a gun in his stomach.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Miss Maxell have heard‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] began Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell heard,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\but was afraid to look out.$
+She also heard two shots. My theory is that Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+were killed, that the murderer first locked both the bedrooms, went$
+through Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys papers, presumably to discover something$
+incriminating himself, and to destroy such documents.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But why not leave the bodies?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because without the bodies no indictment of murder could hold against$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson turned as the girl came in. She was looking very tired,$
+but she was calmer than she had been earlier in the morning.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is there any news?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have searched every inch of the ground,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated to ask the question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am afraid,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy gently, ‚M-^@M-^\that there is very little hope.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But have you searched everywhere?‚M-^@M-^] insisted the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everywhere,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+Soon after, Timothy took the girl away to an hotel for breakfast and to$
+arrange for a room, and the house was left in charge of the police.$
+Later came the famous detective Gilborne, who made an independent$
+search, but he, like his predecessors, failed to discover any further$
+evidence, because he also knew nothing of the disused well, which lay$
+hidden under a rubbish heap.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XV$
+$
+$
+WHO killed Sir John Maxell and his wife?$
+$
+Where had their bodies been hidden? These were the two questions which$
+were to agitate England for the traditional space of nine days. For one$
+day, at any rate, they formed the sole topic of speculation amongst the$
+intelligent section of fifty million people.$
+$
+The first question was easier to answer than the second. It was obvious$
+to the newsmen that the murderer was Cartwright, whose threats of$
+vengeance were recalled and whose appearance at Bournemouth had been$
+described at second-hand by the detective in charge of the case.$
+First-hand information was for the moment denied the pressmen, for$
+Timothy, fully dressed, lay on his bed in a sound sleep. Happily for$
+him, neither then nor later did any of the enterprising newspaper men$
+associate the ‚M-^@M-^\A. C.‚M-^@M-^] in his name with the wanted criminal. He was at$
+least spared that embarrassment.$
+$
+But the story of his vigil as ‚M-^@M-^\a friend of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] was in print long$
+before he woke up to find a small and impatient army of reporters$
+waiting to interview him. He answered the reporters‚M-^@M-^Y interrogations as$
+briefly as possible, bathed and changed and made his way to the hotel$
+where the girl was. She was leaving as he arrived, and the warmth of her$
+greeting almost banished the depression which lay upon him. She put her$
+arm through his so naturally that he did not realise his wonderful$
+fortune.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve got something to tell you,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\unless you know already.$
+All my money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped with a gasp.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean that?‚M-^@M-^] he said seriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is true,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe it was very little and my loss is$
+so insignificant compared with the other awful affair that I am not$
+worrying about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John had money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just seen his lawyers,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\they have been to the bank$
+and there is not a hundred pounds to his credit, and that amount will be$
+absorbed by the cheques he has drawn. He drew a very, very large sum,$
+including my money, from the bank two days ago. You know,‚M-^@M-^] she went on,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that Sir John contemplated leaving for America? He had already$
+given me a hint, asking me how long it would take me to pack my$
+belongings, and I fancy that had something to do with the telegram he$
+received‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Announcing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys escape,‚M-^@M-^] nodded Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was so kind and so gentle,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, her eyes filling with$
+tears, ‚M-^@M-^\that to me he was more like a father. Oh, it is awful, awful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you?‚M-^@M-^] asked the agitated Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do? Good$
+heavens! It is dreadful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall have to work,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl practically and with a little$
+smile. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that will kill me. Hundreds of thousands of girls$
+have to work for their living, Timothy, and I shall have to work for$
+mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy drew a long breath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not if I can help it, you won‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sure I shall make a$
+lot of money. I can feel it in my bones. If a man takes a job‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt talk like that,‚M-^@M-^] she said, pressing his arm, ‚M-^@M-^\and anyway,$
+how could I let you help me or keep me? That sort of thing isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+done‚M-^@M-^Tnot by nice girls.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She laughed, but became sober again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know that Sir John was very much interested in you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In me?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I told you so the other day. I think he liked you, because he was$
+saying how uncomfortable you must be at Vermont House, living in that$
+queer little room of yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did he know I was living at Vermont House?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Vermont House happens to be Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys property,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\In fact, I$
+think it is the only realisable piece of property he has, now that the$
+money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What shall you do immediately?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I think the first step is to get out of$
+this hotel, which is much too expensive for me. I have a few pounds in$
+the bank, but that won‚M-^@M-^Yt last very long.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At his earnest entreaty she agreed to see a solicitor and appoint him to$
+save whatever was possible from the wreckage of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys estate. Two$
+hours passed like as many minutes, until Timothy remembered that he had$
+an appointment with a London reporter‚M-^@M-^Tone Brennan. Brennan he had known$
+in his cinema days, and Timothy literally fell upon his neck.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to tell the boys that hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt already been told,‚M-^@M-^] he said,$
+putting down the newspaper which Brennan handed to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I am as anxious$
+for news as you are. Have there been any developments?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter, ‚M-^@M-^\except that Sir John had no money at the$
+bank and no money could be found in the house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I know,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all his securities were drawn out two days ago.$
+That was the stuff that Cartwright was after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does Miss Maxell know‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Brennan began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does know and she took it like a brick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was about twenty thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] Brennan went on. ‚M-^@M-^\The only other$
+clue the police have is that the safe was opened by Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicate$
+key. The old man had two sets made, one of which he used to keep in his$
+combination safe in his bedroom and the other he carried around with$
+him. Miss Maxell told a story that the night before the murder Lady$
+Maxell asked her to secure possession of the keys in order to open a$
+bureau.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see. Is it suggested that Lady Maxell detached the key of the safe$
+and that it was she who opened it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one theory,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\the police have miles of ‚M-^@M-^Yem!$
+They‚M-^@M-^Yve got everything except the bodies and the murderer. Now come out$
+with that story, Anderson! You must know a great deal more than you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+told, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym simply without a new fact that these evening papers$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got, to hang my story on. Why did Cartwright come to your room,$
+anyway? Do you know him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was an acquaintance of my father‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and perhaps he thought I knew Maxell better than I did.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sounds pretty thin,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter. ‚M-^@M-^\Why should he come to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose I am the only person he knew or knew about,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+patiently. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose he‚M-^@M-^Yd been all round Bournemouth trying to find a$
+familiar name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the reporter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I was a kid when he went to gaol. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+imagine I knew him at all, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had gone out to meet the girl, forgetting to take his watch, and now$
+he was looking round for it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a theory,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Lady Maxell isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+dead at all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Cartwright killed Maxell and Lady Maxell witnessed the murder.$
+Suppose this fellow had to decide whether he would kill the witness or$
+whether he would go away with her? You said the motor-car which came to$
+the house in the middle of the night was the same as that in which Lady$
+Maxell came home. Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely that she should have told the$
+murderer, for some reason or other, that the car was coming, because$
+evidently she had arranged for it to come, and that they went away$
+together? Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely, too, that she was in the plot, and that, so$
+far from being a victim, she was one of the criminals? We know her$
+antecedents. There was some trouble over her stabbing a young American,$
+Reggie van Rhyn. In fact, most of the evidence seems to incriminate her.$
+There is the key, for example. Who else but she could have taken the$
+duplicate key? Doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt it look as though she planned the whole thing,$
+and that her accomplice came in at the last moment to help her get away$
+and possibly to settle Sir John?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take the incident of the two locked bedrooms. Obviously somebody who$
+lived in the house and who knew the family routine must have done that.$
+Both Sir John and Lady Maxell were in the habit of fastening their doors$
+at night, and the servants did not go into the bedrooms unless they were$
+rung for. It seems to me fairly clear that Lady Maxell locked the doors$
+so that the suspicions of the servants should not be aroused in the$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If I had your powers of deduction,‚M-^@M-^] said the admiring Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+should never miss a winner. Where the blazes is my watch?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try under the pillow,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I never put it there,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy, but nevertheless turned the$
+pillow over and stood gaping.$
+$
+For beneath the pillow was a long, stout envelope with a tell-tale blood$
+stain in one corner.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake!‚M-^@M-^] breathed Timothy, and took up the package.$
+$
+It bore no address and was sealed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What on earth is this?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can tell you what those stains are,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Brennan. ‚M-^@M-^\Is$
+there any name on it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open it,‚M-^@M-^] suggested the reporter, and the other obeyed.$
+$
+The contents were even more astonishing, for they consisted of a thick$
+pad of money. They were new Bank of England notes and were bound about$
+by a tight band of paper. On the band was written in Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+handwriting:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Proceeds of the sale of stocks held in trust for Miss Mary$
+    Maxell. ¬£21,300.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The detective in charge of the case was a man of many theories. But his$
+new theory was an uncomfortable one for Timothy Anderson.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This puts a new light upon the case,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+being perfectly frank with you, Mr. Anderson, that the new light isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+very favourable to you. Here you are, outside the building when the$
+crime is committed. You are seen by a policeman a few minutes after the$
+shots are fired, and a portion of the money stolen from the house is$
+discovered under your pillow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Discovered by me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\in the presence of a witness. And are$
+you suggesting that, whilst I was with your policeman, I was also$
+driving the car, or that I was wearing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys cap which was found$
+in the grounds? Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve the finger-print of your man and you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+at liberty to compare it with mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a finger-print anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\it is the print$
+of a knuckle and we do not keep a record of knuckles. No, I admit that$
+the motor-car conflicts a little bit with my theory. Have you any$
+suggestion to offer?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The only suggestion I can make,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is that Cartwright, in a$
+hurry to get away and knowing the position of my room, hid the money$
+there for fear he should be caught with the goods. At any rate, if I$
+were the criminal I would not hide a bloodstained envelope under my$
+pillow. I should at least have the intelligence to burn the envelope and$
+put the money where the servants of this house could not find it. Why,$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt you see,‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously, ‚M-^@M-^\that any of the servants at this$
+boarding-house would have found the envelope if I hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The detective scratched his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a very queer case.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And it is being investigated by very queer people,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+irritably.$
+$
+A little further investigation, however, relieved Timothy of all$
+suspicion. He had not returned to the house until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock that$
+morning. The maid, who had taken him a cup of tea at eight, noticing$
+that he had been out all night, thought it was an excellent opportunity$
+to straighten the room to ‚M-^@M-^\get it off her mind,‚M-^@M-^] as she said. She did$
+not remake the bed, but had tidied it. Whilst sweeping she had seen the$
+envelope lying on the floor near the open window and had picked it up$
+and, for want of a better place, thinking ‚M-^@M-^\it was private‚M-^@M-^] had slipped$
+it under Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys pillow.$
+$
+As Timothy had not been out of sight of the police since the tragedy$
+until his return to his lodgings, there could be no suggestion that he$
+had any part in hiding the envelope. Whatever irritation he felt was$
+dispelled by his large and generous satisfaction when the poverty which$
+threatened Mary was averted. But why should Cartwright hide the money$
+there? Why should he stop in his headlong flight to come to the window,$
+as evidently he did, and throw the package into the room? There were a$
+hundred places where he might have left it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That cousin stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt work,‚M-^@M-^] thought Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and if you think$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys going to rely upon his relationship with me and can use me to look$
+after his money, he‚M-^@M-^Ys made one large mistake.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw the girl again at the official inquiry, and met her on the day$
+after. She was going to Bath where she had some distant relations, and$
+they had met to say good-bye.$
+$
+It was a gloomy occasion‚M-^@M-^Tless gloomy for Timothy than for the girl,$
+because he was already planning a move to the town in which she was$
+taking up her quarters. This cheerful view was banished, however, when$
+she explained that her stay in Bath was merely a temporary expedient.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew has wired asking me to come‚M-^@M-^Tand it seems as good a place$
+as any for a few months. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I shall stay here any longer,‚M-^@M-^]$
+she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want a change of air and a change of scene. Timothy, I feel$
+that I shall never get over Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never is a very long time, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently, and she could$
+only wonder at the tender kindness in his voice.$
+$
+She had little time to wonder, however, for she had a proposition to$
+make to him and she hardly knew how to reduce it to words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you‚M-^@M-^Tare you‚M-^@M-^Tworking?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys broad smile answered her plainly that he was not.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact is,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt quite decided what I am going$
+to do. If you were going down to Bath for good, I was going down to Bath$
+also. Maybe I could start a druggist‚M-^@M-^Ys or buy a store, or run errands$
+for somebody. I am the most accommodating worker.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she began and stopped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he repeated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had an idea that maybe you would like to go on and conduct an$
+independent search‚M-^@M-^Tindependent of the police, I mean‚M-^@M-^Tand find$
+something about the man who killed Sir John, and perhaps bring him to$
+justice. You know, I think you are clever enough,‚M-^@M-^] she went on$
+hurriedly, ‚M-^@M-^\and it would be work after your own heart.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was looking at her steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly, ‚M-^@M-^\but that involves spending a$
+whole lot of money. What misguided person do you suggest would send me$
+out on that kind of job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I thought‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated, and then a little incoherently,$
+‚M-^@M-^\You see, I have the money‚M-^@M-^Tmainly through you‚M-^@M-^Tmy own money, I mean. I$
+feel I have a duty to my poor uncle and I could trust you to do your$
+very best. I could afford it, Timothy‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe laid her hand on his arm and$
+looked up at him almost beseechingly‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\indeed I can afford it. I have$
+more money than I shall ever spend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He patted her hand softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is just the kind of job I should like, and with$
+anybody‚M-^@M-^Ys money but yours, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd be out of the country in two shakes,$
+looking for Mr. Cartwright in the most expensive cities of the world.$
+But, my dear, I cannot accept your commission, because I know just what$
+lies behind it. You think I‚M-^@M-^Ym a restless, rather shiftless sort of$
+fellow, and you want to give me a good time‚M-^@M-^Twith your money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\thank you, but, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was disappointed and for a moment a little hurt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Would two hundred pounds‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she suggested timidly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not your two hundred,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\That lawyer of yours should take$
+better care of your money, Mary. He shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt allow you to make these$
+tempting offers to young men,‚M-^@M-^] he was smiling now. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you go abroad?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps‚M-^@M-^Tsome day,‚M-^@M-^] she said vaguely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John wanted me to go‚M-^@M-^Tand I$
+feel that I should be pleasing him. Some day, yes, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll go over at the same time as you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought of$
+taking a chance in Paris for a while‚M-^@M-^Tyou can make big money in Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In‚M-^@M-^Ta while?‚M-^@M-^] she smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a minute,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if the horse and the jockey are of$
+the same way of thinking. I know a fellow who races pretty extensively$
+in France. He has a horse called Flirt‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held out her hand for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, you‚M-^@M-^Yre incorrigible,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+She did not see him again for twelve months, not indeed until, after a$
+winter spent in Madeira, she put her foot over the gangway of the s.s.$
+_Tigilanes_ and met the quizzical smile of the youth who was waiting to$
+receive her.$
+$
+For Timothy had been in Funchal a month, seeing but unseen, since Mary$
+was generally in bed before the Casino woke up and play reached any$
+exciting level.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVI$
+$
+$
+TIMOTHY sat now on an upturned trunk, his elbows on the rails of the$
+s.s. _Tigilanes_ and his speculative eye roving the river front of$
+Liverpool.$
+$
+It was the last hour of the voyage, and Timothy, who had left Funchal$
+with four hundred pounds in his pocket-book, had exactly three genuine$
+shillings and a five-milreis piece of dubious quality.$
+$
+A man strolled along the deck and fell in at his side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cleaned you out last night, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^] he asked sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh? Oh, yes, I believe they did. That red-haired man had all the luck$
+and most of the cards.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He smiled and Timothy had a swift, happy smile that brought tired little$
+ridges under his eyes. He was not only good-looking and young, but he$
+was interesting.$
+$
+The man at his side took the cigar from his teeth and looked at it$
+before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, you know they were crooks‚M-^@M-^Tthey work this coast line$
+regularly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round, shocked and pained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say? Crooks! What, that little red-haired fellow who has been$
+trying to pick a quarrel with me all the voyage, and the tall,$
+nice-looking Englishman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His companion nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember the Captain warned us not to play cards‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They always do that to be on the safe side,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, but he was$
+obviously uneasy. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I knew they were crooks‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Knew! Good lord! Anybody will tell you. Ask the purser. Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been stung and you can do nothing. The best thing to do is to grin and$
+bear your losses. It is experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy felt the three honest shillings in his pocket and whistled$
+dismally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I were sure‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned abruptly away and raced down the main companion-way to the$
+purser‚M-^@M-^Ys little office under the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Macleod, I want to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir,‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tall pursers are a little suspicious,‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\anything wrong with$
+your bill?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No‚M-^@M-^Tnot unless his name‚M-^@M-^Ys Bill. Shall I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser opened the half-door and admitted him to the sanctuary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are two fellows aboard this packet‚M-^@M-^Ta red-haired fellow named$
+Chelwyn and a disguised duke named Brown‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you know about ‚M-^@M-^Yem?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser made a face. It was intended to convey his lack of real$
+interest in either.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll put it plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said the patient Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Are they crooks?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They play cards,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser diplomatically.$
+$
+He desired at this the eleventh hour to avoid scandal, explanations, and$
+such other phenomena which he associated in his mind with the$
+confrontation of the wise men and their dupes. That sort of thing$
+brought the Line into disrepute, and indirectly reflected upon the$
+ship‚M-^@M-^Ys officers. Besides, the ship was making port, and, like all$
+pursers, he was up to his eyes in work and frantically anxious to clear$
+it off in a minimum time so that he could take a train to his little$
+villa at Lytham, where his family was established.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mr. Anderson, if you‚M-^@M-^Yve been stung,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but the$
+captain gives fair warning the first night out of Cape Town and$
+Madeira‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys where you came aboard, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^Tand there were notices$
+posted up, both in the saloon and in the smoking-room. Have you lost$
+much?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up with some sympathy at the tall, athletic figure with the$
+tired, smiling eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I cleared up ¬£500 at the Funchal Casino,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I reckon I$
+have spent ¬£100 legitimately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The rest is gone, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, Mr. Anderson, I am$
+afraid I can do nothing. The best thing to do is to mark it down against$
+‚M-^@M-^XExperience‚M-^@M-^Y.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll forgive you for being philosophical about my losses,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you be kind enough to tell me the number of Mr. Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+cabin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two seventy-four,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\I say, Mr. Anderson, if I were you$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yd let the matter drop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you would, dear old thing,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, shaking him warmly by$
+the hand, ‚M-^@M-^\and if I were you I should let it drop too. But, as I am$
+me‚M-^@M-^T274, I think you said?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to make any trouble, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+alarmed purser. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve done our best to make you comfortable on the$
+voyage.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I did my best to pay for my ticket, so we‚M-^@M-^Yre quits,‚M-^@M-^] and with a$
+wave of his hand Timothy strode out of the cabin, dodged down past the$
+steward carrying up the luggage to the next deck, and walked swiftly$
+along the carpeted corridor till he found a little number-plate bearing$
+the figures ‚M-^@M-^\274.‚M-^@M-^] He knocked at the cabin door, and gruff voice said,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come in!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Chelwyn, the red-haired man, was in his shirt sleeves, fastening his$
+collar. Brown was sitting on the edge of his bunk, smoking a cigarette,$
+and Chelwyn, who had seen Timothy reflected in the mirror as he came in,$
+was first to recognise him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo, Mr. Anderson, do you want anything?‚M-^@M-^] he asked politely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sorry$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yve had such bad luck‚M-^@M-^Twhat the devil are you doing?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy had shut the door and slipped the bolt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I want something,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You want‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen. I thought you were playing straight, you fellows, or I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have played with you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym willing to take a chance, for that‚M-^@M-^Ys my motto$
+in life, dear lads, but there isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a chance to take when you‚M-^@M-^Yre playing$
+with crooks.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here,‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man, walking over to him and$
+emphasising his words with his forefinger against Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chest, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+kind of stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt amuse me. If you lose your money, lose it like a$
+sportsman and a gentleman, and don‚M-^@M-^Yt squeal.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Boys,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds from you, so step lively.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The suave Mr. Brown, who had been watching the scene with bored eyes,$
+stroking his drooping moustache the while, made a gentle entrance into$
+the conversation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym rather surprised, in fact, I am shocked, Mr. Anderson, that you$
+should take this line,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve lost your money fairly and$
+squarely‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys where you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy pleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling$
+you this. We‚M-^@M-^Yre very near the shore. Somewhere at the back of those$
+warehouses there‚M-^@M-^Ys certain to be a police organisation and a well-paid$
+magistrate. You are going to have a grand opportunity of appearing in$
+the respectable part of the court as a prosecutor, for I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to beat$
+you up‚M-^@M-^Tfirst you,‚M-^@M-^] he pointed to the red-haired Chelwyn, ‚M-^@M-^\and then$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre going to beat me up, are you?‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man and made$
+a quick dive.$
+$
+It was not pretty to watch, unless you took an interest in fighting.$
+They closed for a second and something jolted twice under Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw.$
+He fell back against the cabin partition. He leapt again, but Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+fist met him half-way, and he never really felt what hit him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve won this fight,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I award myself a purse of four$
+hundred pounds. Do you take any interest in these proceedings. Brown?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other man had not moved from his bunk, but now he rose and lifted$
+his dazed companion to his feet.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yd better pay this fellow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll see him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] mumbled the other, but Brown was apparently the$
+brains of the organisation and had merely mentioned his intention of$
+paying out of sheer politeness to his companion.$
+$
+He took a thick pocket-book from his hip pocket and counted out the$
+notes, and Timothy picked them up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll fix you for this,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn, mopping his bleeding lip. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+taken this from me‚M-^@M-^Tnot him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy as he unbolted the door and stepped$
+out.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Some day I‚M-^@M-^Yll get you,‚M-^@M-^] said the livid man, and the finger he pointed$
+at Timothy was shaking with anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He ascended the companion-way feeling remarkably cheerful, and met the$
+purser coming down. That officer regarded him even more suspiciously$
+than ever. But as there were no signs of the fray upon him, the purser$
+went to his cabin relieved, and Timothy passed out to relieve his$
+feelings by the side of the rail. So he sat whilst the big liner was$
+brought alongside the wharf, and then he heard his name spoken and$
+jumped up, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just wanted to tell you, Timothy, in case I did not see you on the$
+train,‚M-^@M-^] she remarked, ‚M-^@M-^\that Mrs. Renfrew has decided not to go back to$
+Bath but to go on to Paris almost immediately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good for Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Bath or Paris will find me$
+hanging around. I nearly came down to you just now to borrow my fare to$
+Bath.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice, ‚M-^@M-^\did you lose all the money you$
+won in Funchal?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy rubbed his nose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt exactly lose it,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I lent it and it has just been$
+repaid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt think it proper your travelling on the same boat.$
+She thinks you ought not to have come to Madeira after me‚M-^@M-^Tus.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was mischief in Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes, in spite of the solemnity of her$
+tone.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about what Mrs. Renfrew thinks,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Why,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre almost as badly off for cousins as I am.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As you are?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any cousins?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hundreds of ‚M-^@M-^Yem,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy glibly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who are they?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, interested.$
+$
+She had reached a stage in their friendship when his relatives were$
+immensely interesting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know their names,‚M-^@M-^] lied Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt give ‚M-^@M-^Yem names but$
+numbers‚M-^@M-^Tone, two, three, four, etc.‚M-^@M-^Tjust at that moment I was thinking$
+of number seventy-nine‚M-^@M-^Tgood morning, Mrs. Renfrew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew was severe and thin, with a yellow face and hooked nose.$
+She was a member of one of the best, if not the best, families in Bath,$
+and it was an unfailing source of pride that she did not know the people$
+that other people knew.$
+$
+Mary watched the encounter with dancing eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I have the pleasure of your company to London?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mrs.$
+Renfrew.$
+$
+She invariably made a point of leaving Mary out, and indeed sustained$
+the pleasant fiction that Mary had no existence on board the ship.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The pleasure will be mine,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I am not travelling with you$
+to London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He said this so innocently that Mrs. Renfrew was in the middle of her$
+next observation before she had any idea that the remark had an$
+offensive interpretation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You seem to have had a very unfortunate experience‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Happily a very hot-looking steward made his appearance at that moment$
+and called Mrs. Renfrew away. She gathered up her charge and with a$
+withering glance at Timothy departed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson, feeling particularly happy, was one of the$
+first to land and strolled along the quay-side waiting within view of$
+the gangway for Mary to disembark. Immediately above him towered the$
+high decks of the _Tigilanes_‚M-^@M-^Ta fact of which he was reminded when,$
+with a crash, a heavy wooden bucket dropped so close to his head that it$
+grazed his shoulder. It was a large bucket, and, dropped from that$
+height, might have caused him considerable physical distress.$
+$
+He looked up.$
+$
+The two card-players with whom he had had some argument were lolling$
+over the rail, their faces turned in quite another direction and talking$
+earnestly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hi!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+They were deaf, it appeared, for they still continued their discussion.$
+A deck hand was passing with a crate load of oranges; one fell out and$
+Timothy picked it up. The attention of Messrs. Chelwyn and Brown was$
+still directed elsewhere, and with a little swing of his arm Timothy$
+sent the orange upon its swift and unerring course. It caught the$
+red-haired man square in the side of the face and burst, and he jumped$
+round with an oath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve dropped your bucket,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sweetly. ‚M-^@M-^\Shall I throw it at$
+you or will you come down and get it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man said something violent, but his companion pulled him away, and$
+Timothy went to look for a seat with peace in his heart.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVII$
+$
+$
+THE train was crowded, but he secured a corner seat in one of the$
+cell-like compartments. It was empty when he entered, but immediately$
+after, to his surprise, Brown and Chelwyn followed him in and deposited$
+their goods upon three seats that they might in the manner of all$
+experienced travellers, occupy breathing space for three at the cost of$
+two tickets.$
+$
+They took no notice of Timothy until the train drew out and he wondered$
+what their game was. It was hardly likely that they would start any$
+rough work with him after their experience of the morning and less$
+likely because these boat trains were well policed.$
+$
+Clear of the Riverside Station the smooth Englishman leant forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you will forget and forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I have nothing to forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown with a smile, ‚M-^@M-^\is very precipitate‚M-^@M-^Twhich$
+means hasty,‚M-^@M-^] he explained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I thought it meant crooked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A spasm contorted the features of Mr. Chelwyn, but he said nothing. As$
+for Brown, he laughed. He laughed heartily but spuriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys not a bad joke,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but to tell you the truth, we mistook$
+you for‚M-^@M-^Tone of us, and my friend and I thought it would be a good joke$
+to get the better of you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was and it wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown, not easily nonplussed. ‚M-^@M-^\Of$
+course, we intended restoring the money to you before you left the$
+ship.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Naturally,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I never thought you would do anything else.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Only you know you rather spoilt our little _esprit_.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If the conversation is to develop in a foreign language,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would only remark: _Honi soit qui mal y pense_,‚M-^@M-^] and the polite Mr.$
+Brown laughed again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You do not mind if my friend and I have a little quiet game by$
+ourselves, if,‚M-^@M-^] he said humorously, ‚M-^@M-^\we swindle one another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I have no objection to watching, but if,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\you should suddenly draw my attention whilst your$
+friend‚M-^@M-^Ys head is turned, to the ease with which I could win a hundred$
+pounds by picking the lady, or discovering the little pea under the$
+little shell, or show me a way of getting rich from any of the other$
+devices which the children of the public schools find so alluring at the$
+country fair, I shall be under the painful necessity of slapping you$
+violently on the wrist.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Thereafter the conversation languished until the train had run through$
+Crewe and was approaching Rugby. It was here that Mr. Brown stopped in$
+the midst of a long, learned discussion on English politics to offer his$
+cigarette-case to Timothy. Timothy chose a cigarette and put it in his$
+pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one of the best Egyptian brands made,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown casually.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Best for you or best for me?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] It was the red-haired Chelwyn who addressed him for the first$
+time. ‚M-^@M-^\What have you to be afraid of? You‚M-^@M-^Yre as scared as a cat! Do you$
+think we want to poison you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Brown produced a flask and poured a modicum of whisky into the cup$
+and handed it to his companion, then he drank himself. Then, without$
+invitation he poured a little more into the cup and offered it to$
+Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let bygones be bygones,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no desire to be a bygone,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I would much rather be$
+a herenow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Nevertheless, he took the cup and smelt it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Butyl chloride,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\has a distinctive odour. I suppose you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+call it by its technical name, and to you it is just vulgarly ‚M-^@M-^Xa$
+knock-out drop.‚M-^@M-^Y Really,‚M-^@M-^] he said, handing back the cup, ‚M-^@M-^\you boys are$
+so elementary. Where did you learn it all‚M-^@M-^Tfrom the movies?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The red-haired man half rose from his seat with a growl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply, and with a jerk of his hand he flung$
+open the carriage door.$
+$
+The men shrank back at the sight of the rapidly running line, and at the$
+certainty of death which awaited any who left the train on that side of$
+the carriage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Start something,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yll undertake to put either one$
+or both of you on to the line. We‚M-^@M-^Yre going at about sixty miles an hour,$
+and a fellow that went out there wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be taking a chance. Now is$
+there going to be a rough house?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Close the door, close the door,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown nervously. ‚M-^@M-^\What a$
+stupid idea, Mr. Anderson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy swung the door to and the man moved up towards him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym just going to put it to you plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said Brown. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve made$
+the voyage out to the Cape and the voyage back and the only mug we met$
+was you. What we won from you just about paid our expenses, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+putting it to you, as a sportsman and a gentleman, that you should let$
+us have half of that stuff back.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The sportsman in me admires your nerve,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I suppose$
+it is the gentleman part that returns an indignant ‚M-^@M-^XNo!‚M-^@M-^Y to your$
+interesting observation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brown turned to his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, that‚M-^@M-^Ys that, Len,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yll just have to let the money$
+go. It is a pity,‚M-^@M-^] he said wistfully and his companion grunted.$
+$
+That ended the conversation so far as the journey was concerned, and$
+Timothy heard no more until he was in the gloomy courtyard at Euston$
+Station and stepping into his taxi.$
+$
+To his surprise it was the red-haired man who approached him, and$
+something in his manner prevented Timothy from taking the action which$
+he otherwise would have thought necessary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here, young fellow,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you watch Brown‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys wild.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not exactly tame,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt take any notice of me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man a little bitterly. ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+engaged in the rough work. I should have got two hundred out of your$
+money‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys what made me so wild. Brown paid all my expenses and gives$
+me ten pound a week and a commission. It sounds funny to you, doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it, but it is the truth,‚M-^@M-^] and somehow Timothy knew that the man was not$
+lying.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys finished with me‚M-^@M-^Tsays I am a hoodoo,‚M-^@M-^] said the little man. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve got out of five weeks‚M-^@M-^Y work? Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand and disclosed two ten-pound notes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys dangerous,‚M-^@M-^] he warned Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you make any mistake$
+about that. I was only wild because I was losing my money, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys wild$
+because you‚M-^@M-^Yve got fresh with him and caught him out every time. Good$
+night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He felt in his pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying, it is a plausible lie and one that pleases me,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\This will salve my conscience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped two notes into the man‚M-^@M-^Ys hands.$
+$
+Chelwyn was speechless for a moment. Then he asked:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And where are you staying in London, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel,‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll remember that. I$
+shall hear if anything is going on and I‚M-^@M-^Yll ‚M-^@M-^Yphone you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+gentleman, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So Mr. Brown said,‚M-^@M-^] remarked Timothy and drove off, feeling unusually$
+cheerful.$
+$
+If Timothy could be cheerful under the depressing conditions which$
+prevailed on the night of his arrival in London, he was a veritable$
+pattern of cheer. A drizzling rain was falling as the taxi squeaked its$
+way through a labyrinth of mean streets. He had glimpses of$
+wretched-looking people, grotesque of shape and unreal, through the$
+rain-blurred window of the cab.$
+$
+Then suddenly the character of the streets changed, and he was in a$
+broad street twinkling with light. There was a glimpse of trees, wide$
+open spaces, dotted with light. The street grew busier and the traffic$
+thicker, then suddenly the cab turned again into semi-darkness and$
+pulled up before the hotel.$
+$
+A porter opened the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do I think of Madeira?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy of the astonished man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had time to think. Will I be staying long in London? No. What$
+are my opinions of the political crisis which has arisen in my absence?$
+I would rather not say.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It takes a great deal to upset the equilibrium of a well-conducted hall$
+man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you booked your room?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Timothy meekly admitted that he had.$
+$
+He woke to a London much more beautiful, to a vista of old-world$
+buildings such as Cruikshank loved to draw, to a green square and$
+glimpses of greener trees.$
+$
+Mary was staying at the Carlton, but he had arranged to meet her for$
+lunch. He had not arranged to meet her dragon, but he knew she would be$
+there. He had breakfasted, and was on the point of leaving the hotel,$
+when Chelwyn came.$
+$
+To say that Timothy regretted his generosity of the night before would$
+be to do him an injustice. Nevertheless, he had some misgivings as to$
+whether he had not been a little too generous. The appearance of Mr.$
+Chelwyn, early in the morning, looking so spruce and confident, was in$
+itself a suspicious happening, though events proved that the suspicion$
+was unfounded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you alone for a moment, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^] asked the red-haired$
+man.$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come along to the drawing-room,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+It was the one public room which would be empty at that time of the$
+morning. Mr. Chelwyn deposited his hat and stick and brand-new yellow$
+gloves before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mr. Anderson, I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell you a few facts which will$
+surprise you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had a gold brick sent to you by your Uncle George in$
+Alaska, have you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy dubiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Because I‚M-^@M-^Ym not buying that$
+kind of fact.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man smiled and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is hardly likely I should try that stuff on you, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No,$
+this is a much more serious matter. Before I go any farther I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell$
+you that I am not asking for money. I am grateful to you for what you$
+did to me last night, Mr. Anderson. A crook has a wife and children the$
+same as anybody else. I have been in this funny business for ten years,$
+but now I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of it for good.‚M-^@M-^] He looked round and dropped his voice,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson, I told you last night that we‚M-^@M-^Yve been five or six weeks$
+away from England. Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt that sound strange to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is because you don‚M-^@M-^Yt know the game,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\As a rule,$
+when we‚M-^@M-^Yre working these liners, we go out to Cape Town and come back by$
+the next ship that sails. What do you think we stayed at Funchal$
+for‚M-^@M-^Tthere‚M-^@M-^Ys no money in short voyages‚M-^@M-^Tit‚M-^@M-^Ys all on the long run from$
+Madeira to Cape Town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt the slightest idea,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy wearily. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt even$
+remember seeing you in Funchal‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We laid low,‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That may be, but if you‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell me the interesting story of$
+your life, Ginger, I beg that you will cut it short‚M-^@M-^Tthe history, I$
+mean, not necessarily your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell it to you as quickly as possible,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt always work with Brown. In fact, I‚M-^@M-^Yve only worked with him about$
+three times before. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man with the broads‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The broads?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\With the cards,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I say that I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man$
+with the broads as some of the others. I‚M-^@M-^Yve got a bit of a reputation$
+for scrapping. I‚M-^@M-^Yve never left a pal in the lurch and I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been$
+ready for any ‚M-^@M-^Xrough house‚M-^@M-^Y that came along. About two months ago Brown$
+sent for me‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got a flat off Piccadilly and lives like a lord. He$
+told me he was going to Madeira on a special job, that he‚M-^@M-^Yd been$
+employed by a lady in Paris‚M-^@M-^Ta Madame Serpilot (you‚M-^@M-^Yd better write that$
+down in your pocket-book)‚M-^@M-^Tto shepherd a young lady who was coming over.$
+Mind you, there was no harm intended to the young lady, but the general$
+idea was that she might be accompanied by a man, and he was the fellow$
+who had to be looked after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was the lady‚M-^@M-^Ys name?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man without hesitation, ‚M-^@M-^\and you were the fellow$
+we were asked to put out of business. Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys idea was to break you;$
+then, when you got to London, one of his pals would have met you and$
+offered to lend you money. They‚M-^@M-^Yd have framed up a charge against you of$
+obtaining money by false pretences, and you would have been pinched.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys eyebrows rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Was this Mrs. Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys plan?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, but the man shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir, she gave just the details to Brown. She never said what was to$
+be done to you, according to him, but you were to be stopped going$
+around with the young lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you‚M-^@M-^Yve got me,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe she‚M-^@M-^Ys an old widow, but$
+Brown never told me much about her. He got instructions from her while$
+he was in Paris, but I never discovered how. I went to Madeira with him$
+because he knew I was tough‚M-^@M-^Tbut I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt tough enough,‚M-^@M-^] he added with a$
+dry smile.$
+$
+Timothy held out his hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ginger,‚M-^@M-^] he said solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\please forgive the orange!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mind that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\that‚M-^@M-^Ys all in the day‚M-^@M-^Ys work.$
+It made me a bit wild, and my eye‚M-^@M-^Ys feeling sore, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that$
+worry you. What you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to do now is to look out for Brown, because$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll have you as sure as death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll look out for Madame Serpilot, too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I think I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+to Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys not in Paris now, I can tell you that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\The wire$
+Brown got at Liverpool was from Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\is even more attractive than Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                             CHAPTER XVIII$
+$
+$
+CHELWYN left Timothy with something to think about. Who was Madame$
+Serpilot, this old lady who had such an interest in Mary travelling$
+alone? And why, oh! why had she left Paris for Monte Carlo at the fag$
+end of the season? For he and Mary had privately decided between them$
+that London and Paris should only be stopping places on the route to the$
+Riviera. Why should Madame Serpilot have changed her plans at the same$
+time? There was something more than a coincidence in this. At lunch-time$
+he had Mary to herself, her chaperon having a headache.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\can you tell me why we changed our plans on the boat$
+and decided to go straight on to Monte Carlo instead of staying in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said readily. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember my telling you about those$
+beautiful books of views that I saw on the ship?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where did you see them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I found them in my cabin one day. I think the steward must have left$
+them,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\They were most wonderful productions, full of coloured$
+prints and photographs‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt I tell you about them?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I remember,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\Found them in your cabin, eh? Well,$
+nobody left any beautiful or attractive pictures of Monte Carlo in my$
+berth, but I think that won‚M-^@M-^Yt stop me going on to Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was an opportunity she had been seeking for a week and she seized it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want to ask you something, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew told me$
+the other day that they call you ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson. Why is that,$
+Timothy?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because I take a chance, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been taking$
+chances all my life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not a gambler, Timothy, are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked gravely. ‚M-^@M-^\I know you$
+bet and play cards, but men do that for amusement, and somehow it is all$
+right. But when men start out to make a living, and actually make a$
+living, by games of chance, they somehow belong to another life and$
+another people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was silent.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre just too good to go that way, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she went on. ‚M-^@M-^\There are$
+lots of chances that a man can take in this world, in matching his$
+brains, his strength and his skill against other men, and when he wins$
+his stake is safe. He doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose it the next day or the next month,$
+and he‚M-^@M-^Ys picking winners all the time, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His first inclination was to be nettled. She was wounding the tender$
+skin of his vanity, and he was startled to discover how tender a skin$
+that was. All that she said was true and less than true. She could not$
+guess how far his mind and inclination were from commonplace labour and$
+how very little work came into the calculations of his future. He looked$
+upon a job as a thing not to be held and developed into something$
+better, but as a stopgap between two successful chances. He was almost$
+shocked when this truth came home to him. The girl was nervous, and$
+painfully anxious not to hurt him, and yet well aware that she was$
+rubbing a sore place.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, for your sake, as well as for mine, for you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of$
+mine, I want to be proud of you, to see you past this present phase of$
+life. Mrs. Renfrew speaks of you as a gambler, and says your name, even$
+at your age, is well known as one who would rather bet than buy. That$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt true, Timothy, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She put her hand on his and looked into his face. He did not meet her$
+eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that is true, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said steadily. ‚M-^@M-^\How it comes to be$
+true, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite know. I suppose I have drifted a little over the$
+line, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym grateful to you for pulling me up. Oh, no, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt regret$
+the past‚M-^@M-^Tit has all been useful‚M-^@M-^Tand I have made good on chances, but I$
+see there are other chances that a man can take than putting his money$
+on the pace of a horse or backing against zero. Maybe, when I get back$
+to London I‚M-^@M-^Yll settle down into a respectable citizen and keep hens or$
+something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was speaking seriously, though at first she thought he was being$
+sarcastic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you won‚M-^@M-^Yt gamble again?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He hesitated to reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I mean it isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair of me to ask$
+you. It is almost cruel,‚M-^@M-^] she smiled, ‚M-^@M-^\to let you go to Monte Carlo and$
+ask you not to put money on the tables. But promise me, Timothy, that$
+when I tell you to stop playing, you will stop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here‚M-^@M-^Ys my hand on it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, brightening up already at the$
+prospect of being allowed to gamble at all. ‚M-^@M-^\Hereafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He raised$
+his hand solemnly. ‚M-^@M-^\By the way,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, ‚M-^@M-^\do you know a lady named$
+Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I do not,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have never heard the name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have no relations or friends in France?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] she replied immediately.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What made you go to France at all?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\When I heard from you,$
+Mary, you talked about taking a holiday in Madeira before setting up$
+house in Bath, and the first thing I knew of your intention to go abroad$
+again was the letter you sent me just before I started for Madeira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wanted to go a year ago, after Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\then$
+Mrs. Renfrew couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt take the trip‚M-^@M-^Tone of her younger children had$
+measles.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has that woman children?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in an awed voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be absurd. Of course she has children. It was she who decided on$
+making the trip. She writes little articles in the _Bath County$
+Herald_‚M-^@M-^Ta local paper‚M-^@M-^Ton the care of children and all that sort of$
+thing. She‚M-^@M-^Ys not really a journalist, she is literary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\sometimes they write poetry, sometimes recipes$
+for ice cream‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xtake three cups of flour, a pint of cream in which an$
+egg has been boiled and a pinch of vanilla‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled. Evidently Timothy had hit upon the particular brand of$
+journalism to which Mrs. Renfrew was addicted.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\there was to have been a sort of Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Welfare Meeting in Paris next week‚M-^@M-^Tan International affair‚M-^@M-^Tand when we$
+were in Madeira she received an invitation to attend with a free return$
+ticket‚M-^@M-^Twasn‚M-^@M-^Yt that splendid?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Splendid,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy absently. ‚M-^@M-^\Naturally you thought it was an$
+excellent opportunity to go also.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And now you have arrived here you find that the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Meeting has been postponed for ten years?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you know that the meeting had been postponed?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I guessed it,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\such things have happened before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The truth is,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\nobody knows anything about this$
+meeting, and the letter which Mrs. Renfrew sent to the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Society in Paris was waiting for us when we arrived at the Carlton. It$
+had been returned‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XAddressee Unknown.‚M-^@M-^Y Mrs. Renfrew had put the Carlton$
+address inside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was ample excuse for speculation of an innocuous kind. Mrs. Renfrew$
+had been approached because it was known by this mysterious somebody$
+that she would take the girl with her, and this sinister somebody had$
+hired two thugs to shepherd her from Madeira and to put Timothy out of$
+action, should he decide to accompany the party to France. The situation$
+was distinctly interesting.$
+$
+Three days later the party crossed the Channel. Timothy had high hopes$
+of adventure, which were fated to be more than fulfilled. They stayed$
+three days in Paris and he had the time of his life. He went to the$
+races at Maisons Lafitte, and came back glowing with a sense of his$
+virtue, for he had not made a bet. He drifted in to the baccara rooms at$
+Enghien, watched tens of thousands of francs change hands, and returned$
+to Paris that night with a halo fitted by Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys own hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre really wonderful, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you are$
+allowed one final flutter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym saving that up for Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+Since his arrival in Paris he had lost the right to his name, for he was$
+taking no chances. If he went abroad at night he kept to the brilliantly$
+illuminated boulevards or the crowded caf√©s. He kept clear of the$
+crowds‚M-^@M-^Tespecially crowds which formed quickly and for no apparent$
+reason.$
+$
+He was taking no chances because he felt it was not fair upon the$
+particular genius who presided over his destinies that he should$
+squander his luck in a miraculous escape from death or disablement. Only$
+once, when dining at the Scribe, did he think he saw the familiar face$
+of Mr. Brown. With an apology he left the two ladies and made his way$
+with difficulty through the crowded restaurant, only to find that his$
+man had disappeared.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\These caf√©s have as many doors as a trick-scene,‚M-^@M-^] he grumbled when he$
+came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you see a friend of yours?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not so much a friend as one who has a financial interest in me,‚M-^@M-^]$
+replied Timothy.$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew had thawed a little under the beneficent influences of$
+Paris. She was busy sending off picture-postcards and had written to$
+Bath her first impression of the French capital to the extent of three$
+columns. She had also written a poem which began: ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, city of light$
+that shines so bright,‚M-^@M-^] and went on rhyming ‚M-^@M-^\vain‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\Seine,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\gay‚M-^@M-^]$
+with ‚M-^@M-^\play,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\joy‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\alloy,‚M-^@M-^] through twenty-three stanzas.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I rather pride myself,‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew, ‚M-^@M-^\upon that description of$
+Paris‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xthe city of light.‚M-^@M-^Y Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think it is very original, Mr.$
+Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically. ‚M-^@M-^\Parisians have called it the$
+‚M-^@M-^XVille Lumi√®re‚M-^@M-^Y for about two hundred years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys almost the same, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew. ‚M-^@M-^\How clever the$
+French are!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew did not speak French and took a more generous view of the$
+young man when she discovered that he did. It fell to Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys lot to$
+order tickets, arrange cabs, pay bills and act as unofficial courier to$
+the party. He was anxious to be gone from Paris, impatient for the big$
+game to begin. For some reason, he did not anticipate that any harm$
+would come to the girl. This struck him as strange later, but at the$
+moment all his thoughts were centred upon the match between himself and$
+this old French lady who had set herself out to separate him from Mary$
+Maxell.$
+$
+No unpleasant incident‚M-^@M-^Tthe crowded condition of the dining-car$
+excepted‚M-^@M-^Tmarred the journey to Monte Carlo. There was the inevitable$
+night spent in a stuffy sleeping-berth in a car that rocked and swayed$
+to such an extent that Timothy expected it to jump the line, as$
+thousands of other passengers have expected it to do; and they came with$
+the morning to the Valley of the Rhone, a wide, blue, white-flecked$
+stream flowing between gaunt hills, past solitary ch√¢teaux and strange$
+walled towns, which looked as if they had been kept under glass cases$
+for centuries, that the modern world should be reminded of the dangers$
+under which our forefathers lived. So to Marseilles, and a long, hot and$
+slow journey to Nice.$
+$
+To the girl it was a pilgrimage of joy. She would not have missed a$
+single moment of that ride. The blue sea, the white villas with their$
+green jalousies, the banked roses over wall and pergola and the$
+warm-scented breeze, and above all the semi-tropical sun, placed her in$
+a new world, a wonder world more beautiful than imagination had painted.$
+$
+There is something about Monte Carlo which is very satisfying. It is so$
+orderly, so clean, so white and bright, that you have the impression$
+that it is carefully dusted every morning and that the villas on the$
+hills are taken down weekly by tender hands, polished and replaced.$
+$
+There is nothing garish about Monte Carlo, for all its stucco and$
+plaster. Some of the buildings, and particularly the Casino, were$
+compared by the irreverent Timothy to the White City, but it was a$
+refined White City and the Casino itself, with its glass-roofed porch,$
+its great, solemn hanging lamps and its decorous uniformed attendants,$
+had something of the air of a National Bank.$
+$
+Timothy took a room at the H√¥tel de Paris, where the girl was staying,$
+and lost no time in seeking information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge. ‚M-^@M-^\There is a madame who bears that$
+name, I think, but she is not staying here, monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of whom should I inquire, I pray you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in the vernacular.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of the Municipal Council, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge, ‚M-^@M-^\or, if the$
+madame is a wealthy madame, of the manager of the Credit Lyonnais, who$
+will perhaps inform monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thanks many times,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He went first to the Credit Lyonnais, and found the manager extremely$
+polite but uncommunicative. It was not the practice of the bank, he$
+said, to disclose the addresses of their clients. He would not say that$
+Madame Serpilot was his client, but if she were, he could certainly not$
+give her address to any unauthorised person. From this Timothy gathered$
+that Madame Serpilot was a client. He went on to the Mairie and met with$
+better fortune. The Mairie had no respect for persons. It was there to$
+supply information and what the Mairie of Monte Carlo does not know$
+about Monaco, the cleverest detective force in the world would be$
+wasting its time trying to discover.$
+$
+Madame Serpilot lived at the Villa Condamine. The Villa Condamine was$
+not, as the name suggested, in the poorer part of Monte Carlo but in$
+that most exclusive territory, the tiny peninsula of Cap Martin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has madam been a resident long?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For one hundred and twenty-nine days,‚M-^@M-^] replied the official promptly.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame hired the villa furnished from the agent, of the Grand Duchess$
+Eleana who, alas! was destroyed in that terrible revolution.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He gave Timothy some details of the family from which the Grand Duchess$
+had sprung, the amount of her income in pre-war days, and was passing to$
+her eccentricities when Timothy took his departure. He was not$
+interested in the Grand Duchess Eleana, alive or dead.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIX$
+$
+$
+HE went to the house agent on the main street and from him procured$
+the exact position of Madame Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys residence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\An old madame?‚M-^@M-^] said the agent. ‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur, I cannot say that she is$
+old. And I cannot say that she is young.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He thought a moment, as though endeavouring to find some reason for this$
+reticence on the subject of her age, and then added:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have not seen her. Madame is a widow,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Alas! there are$
+so many in France as the result of the terrible war.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then she is young,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\They didn‚M-^@M-^Yt send old men to the$
+front.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may be young,‚M-^@M-^] replied the agent, ‚M-^@M-^\or she may be old. One does not$
+know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the assistant who had shown the lady the house and had taken$
+the documents for her to sign. The assistant was aged sixteen, and at$
+the age of sixteen most people above twenty are listed amongst the aged.$
+He was certain she was a widow and very feeble, because she walked with$
+a stick. She always wore a heavy black veil, even when she was in the$
+garden.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it not natural,‚M-^@M-^] said the house agent romantically, ‚M-^@M-^\that the madame$
+who has lost all that makes life worth living should no longer desire$
+the world to look upon her face?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It may be natural in Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not natural$
+in London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He located the house on a large plan which the obliging agent produced,$
+and went back to the hotel, firmly resolved to take the first$
+opportunity of calling on Madame Serpilot and discovering what object$
+she had in view when she arranged to endanger his young life.$
+$
+Mary was waiting for him, a little impatiently for one who had such a$
+horror of gambling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have to get tickets at the Bureau,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\and the concierge$
+says we must have special membership cards for the Cercle Priv√©e.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The tickets were easy to procure, and they passed into the great saloon$
+where, around five tables, stood silent ovals of humanity. The scene was$
+a weird one to Timothy and fascinating too. Besides this, all the other$
+gambling games in the world, all the roulette tables and baccara$
+outfits, were crude and amateurish. The eight croupiers who sat at each$
+table in their black frock coats and their black ties, solemn visaged,$
+unemotional, might have been deacons in committee. The click of rakes$
+against chips, the whirr of the twirling ball, the monotonous sing-song$
+announcement of the chief croupier‚M-^@M-^Tit was a ritual and a business at$
+one and the same time.$
+$
+It was amazing to reflect that, year in and year out, from ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock$
+in the morning until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock at night (until midnight in the Cercle$
+Priv√©e) these black-coated men sat at their tables, twirling their$
+rakes, watching without error every note or counter that fell on the$
+table, separating notes from chips with a deftness that was amazing,$
+doing this in such an atmosphere of respectability that the most rabid$
+anti-gambler watching the scene must come in time to believe that$
+roulette was a legitimate business exercise.$
+$
+Through the years this fringe of people about the table would remain,$
+though units would go out, and as units went out new units would replace$
+them, and everlastingly would sit shabby old men and women with their$
+cryptic notebooks, making their tableaux with red and black pencils,$
+religiously recording the result of every coup, staking now and again$
+their five-franc pieces, and watching them raked to the croupier with$
+stony despair or drawing with trembling hands the few poor francs which$
+fortune had sent them.$
+$
+Timothy was very silent when they passed the portals of the Cercle$
+Priv√©e, into that wonderful interior which, viewed from the entrance$
+room, had the appearance of some rich cathedral.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you think of them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mary.$
+$
+He did not answer at once.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did you think of the people?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded again. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you see$
+that quaint old woman‚M-^@M-^Ttaking a chance? I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+really didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and sighed.$
+$
+The roulette table did not attract him. He strolled off to watch the$
+players at _trente et quarante_. Here the procedure was more$
+complicated. One of the officials dealt two lines of cards, ending each$
+when the pips added to something over thirty. The top line stood for$
+black, the lower line for red, and that which was nearest to thirty won.$
+After mastering this, the process was simple; you could either back the$
+red or the black, or you could bet that the first card that was dealt$
+was identical with the colour that won, or was the reverse.$
+$
+The game interested him. It had certain features which in a way were$
+fascinating. He noticed that the croupier never spoke of the black. The$
+black might have had no existence at the _trente et quarante_ table;$
+either ‚M-^@M-^\red won‚M-^@M-^] or ‚M-^@M-^\red lost.‚M-^@M-^] He staked a louis and won twice. He$
+staked another and lost it. Then he won three coups of a louis and$
+looked around uncertainly, almost guiltily, for Mary.$
+$
+She was watching the roulette players, and Timothy took a wad of bills$
+from his pocket and counted out six milles. That was another thing he$
+was to discover: there were three classes of players‚M-^@M-^Tthose who punted$
+in one or five louis pieces, those who bet handsomely in milles (a$
+thousand-franc note is a ‚M-^@M-^\mille‚M-^@M-^] and has no other name), and those who$
+went the maximum of twelve thousand francs on each coup.$
+$
+Money had no value. He threw six thousand down to the croupier and$
+received in exchange six oblong plaques like thin cakes of blue soap. He$
+put a thousand francs on the black and lost it. He looked round$
+apprehensively for Mary, but she was still intent upon the roulette$
+players. He ventured another thousand, and lost that too. A young$
+Englishman sitting at the table looked up with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre betting against the tableau,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The table is running red$
+to-night. Look!‚M-^@M-^] He showed a little notebook ruled into divisions, and$
+long lines of dots, one under the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all these$
+are reds. The table has only swung across to black twice for any run,$
+and then it was only a run of four. If you bet against the table you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+go broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At any other place than at the tables at Monte Carlo advice of this$
+character, and intimate references to financial possibilities, would be$
+resented. But the Rooms, like the grave, level all the players, who are$
+a great family banded together in an unrecognised brotherhood for the$
+destruction of a common enemy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance against the table,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I shall go$
+broke, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman laughed.$
+$
+The four thousand francs he had left went the same way as their friends$
+and Timothy changed another six thousand and threw two on the black.$
+Then, acting on the impulse of the moment, he threw down the remaining$
+four.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned at the shocked voice and Mary was standing behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you gamble like that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He tried to smile, but produced a grimace.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, it is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is only francs, and francs aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+real money, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She turned and walked away and he followed. The Englishman, twisting$
+round in his chair, said something. Timothy thought he was asking$
+whether he should look after his money and answered ‚M-^@M-^\Certainly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl walked to one of the padded benches by the wall and sat down.$
+There was such real trouble in her face that Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys heart sank.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is my last fling and you told me I$
+could have it. After to-night I cut out everything that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt qualify$
+for the ‚M-^@M-^Xearned income‚M-^@M-^Y column of the tax-surveyor.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt the amount of money you were$
+venturing, but there was something in your face which made me feel‚M-^@M-^Twhy!$
+I just felt sick,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary!‚M-^@M-^] he said in surprise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know I‚M-^@M-^Ym being unreasonable,‚M-^@M-^] she interrupted, ‚M-^@M-^\but Timothy, I‚M-^@M-^TI$
+just don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to think of you like this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked into his dejected face and the softest light that ever shone$
+in woman‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes was in hers.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said, half in jest, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yre paying the penalty for$
+having a girl friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying the penalty for being a loafer,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily. ‚M-^@M-^\I think$
+there must be some bad blood in us. Mary, I know what I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and took one of her hands. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing the right to love you,$
+dearest.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a queer place for such a confession, and in her wildest dreams$
+the girl never imagined that the first word of love spoken to her by any$
+man would come in a gambling saloon at Monte Carlo. Above her where she$
+sat was the great canvas of the Florentine Graces; half nude reliefs on$
+the ceiling dangled glittering chains of light and over all sounded the$
+monotonous voice of the croupier:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tet couleur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The young Englishman at the table turned round with an inquiring lift of$
+his eyebrows, and Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wants to know if I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and honestly$
+Mary, I am. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going back to London when this trip‚M-^@M-^Ys over, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going to start at the bottom and work up.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to lie to you, or pretend any longer. I just love you,$
+Mary, and if you‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for me, I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good. I have been a gambler,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\a poor, low gambler, and all the time I‚M-^@M-^Yve thought I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+clever! I‚M-^@M-^Yve been going round puffed up with my own self-importance, and$
+my head‚M-^@M-^Ys been so much in the air that I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt seen just where my feet$
+were leading me,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\This sounds like the sort of thing you$
+get at the Salvation Army penitent form,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I‚M-^@M-^Ym straight and$
+sincere.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you are, Timothy, but you needn‚M-^@M-^Yt start at the bottom. I have my$
+money‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop where you are, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\Not a penny would I take$
+from you, darling.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did they ring that bell for?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+It was the second time the tinkle of sound had come from the croupier at$
+the _trente et quarante_ table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Heaven knows!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe it is to call the other$
+worshippers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the young Englishman looked round and said something.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he say?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He said seventeen,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Was that the number you backed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no numbers on that table except No. 1‚M-^@M-^Tand No. 1 is the fat$
+man with the rake‚M-^@M-^The gets it coming and going. Mary, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to ask$
+you one question: If I make good will you marry me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was silent and again the voice of the croupier came:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tcouleur gagne.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What does ‚M-^@M-^Xrouge perd‚M-^@M-^Y mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked. ‚M-^@M-^\He has said that ever so many$
+times.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means ‚M-^@M-^Xblack wins,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does black always win?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not always,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe he‚M-^@M-^Ys only saying that to lure$
+me back to the table. Mary, what do you say?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and to the scandal of the one attendant who was$
+watching them he bent forward and kissed her.$
+$
+A terrible act this, for the gold-laced and liveried footman, who came$
+with slow, majestic steps to where they sat.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\this is not done.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked up at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Chassez-vous_,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly.$
+$
+It was startling French, but it was the nearest he could get at the$
+moment to ‚M-^@M-^\chase yourself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the bell tinkled, and the young Englishman rose, thrust a small$
+packet of money into his pocket and came toward them, bearing what$
+looked to be a large book without covers. His face was a little haggard$
+and the perspiration stood upon his forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is getting on my nerves, old man. You had better play yourself,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, and he handed the book to Timothy, and Timothy looked vaguely$
+from his hands to the hot Englishman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys this?‚M-^@M-^] he croaked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A run of twenty-eight on the black,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+phenomenal! You wanted me to go on, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you? I asked you whether I$
+should play your thousand francs. The bank bust four times‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+hear them ring for more money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded. He had no words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, your six went to twelve and I left the maximum run,‚M-^@M-^] the$
+Englishman said. ‚M-^@M-^\I asked you if that was right and you nodded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I nodded,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy mechanically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve won twenty-seven and a half maximums.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at the money in his hand, looked up at the ceiling and$
+gulped something down.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] he gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\I am obliged to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was inadequate, but it was all that he could say.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\I won a lot of money myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a great hand at arithmetic,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\will you tell me$
+how many pounds twenty-seven and a half maximums make?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a remarkable situation. Somebody should have laughed, but they$
+were all too serious, the girl as serious as Timothy, and the young$
+Englishman scrawling calculations on a loose page of his notebook.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thirty-five francs to a pound,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\makes ¬£340 a coup.$
+Twenty-seven and a half is about‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and he gripped the other‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and wrung it.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you, fairy godmother‚M-^@M-^TI don‚M-^@M-^Yt know your other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They stood together watching his lanky figure, as he, wholly unconscious$
+of the providential part he had played, moved down to the roulette$
+table, eyeing the game with the air of superiority which every player of$
+_trente et quarante_ has for a game with a paltry maximum of six$
+thousand francs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] whispered the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it wonderful?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He put the money into his pocket and it bulged untidily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do with it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Give it to the poor,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, taking her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the poor?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was wondering whether his fortune had driven him mad.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The poor,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly, ‚M-^@M-^\money won by gambling‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense,‚M-^@M-^] she broke in, ‚M-^@M-^\to what poor are you giving it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To poor Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] said he. ‚M-^@M-^\Let us dash madly to the bar and drink$
+orangeade.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XX$
+$
+$
+THE band was playing one of de Courville‚M-^@M-^Ys new revue tunes, and the$
+Caf√© de Paris was crowded out. There had been a big influx of visitors$
+from Nice, and Monte Carlo presented an appearance comparable with the$
+height of the season. Mrs. Renfrew had motored up to La Turbie, and a$
+bank of cloud having descended upon the mountain made the road$
+dangerous. (Those who have journeyed from the Corniche to Monte Carlo by$
+night will appreciate just how dangerous is that road.) She had,$
+therefore, elected to spend the night at the hotel on the top of the$
+hill.$
+$
+This information she had telephoned to the girl on the night following$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys great win, and had added that she could see ‚M-^@M-^\the twinkling$
+lights of Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^] and that ‚M-^@M-^\the misty spaces of ocean filled her$
+with strange unrest,‚M-^@M-^] which observation had been repeated to the$
+unsympathetic Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It must be awful to have a mind like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and then, ‚M-^@M-^\Mary,$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve been a long time waiting to exchange confidences about cousins.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no confidences to give you about Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary with a$
+smile, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have been on the point of telling me about your cousin$
+so often that I feel a little curious.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The story he had to tell was not a nice one. It meant opening old wounds$
+and reviving sad memories, but it had to be done. She was not so shocked$
+as he had expected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have not told me anything new,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\You see, all$
+along I have known that the ‚M-^@M-^XA.C.‚M-^@M-^Y in your name stood for ‚M-^@M-^XAlfred$
+Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^Y and once uncle told me that he had known a relative of$
+yours, and I guessed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly she demanded:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think Cartwright is in Europe?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am certain. That is, if Morocco is in Europe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have had$
+it in the back of my mind ever since the crime was committed that that$
+is the place he would make for. You see, in the few minutes I had with$
+him he told me, perhaps not the whole of the story, but at any rate his$
+version. He knows Morocco and has been there before. He spoke about a$
+Moorish chief named El Mograb, who wanted him to stay with the tribe,$
+and he told me he was sorry he had not followed the Moor‚M-^@M-^Ys advice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell the police that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did not tell the police very much about that visit. Cartwright$
+revived his accusations against Sir John. It meant digging up these$
+charges, and that is what I did not wish to do, for‚M-^@M-^Tfor‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For my sake?‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys about the size of it,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+A little stream of diners were leaving the restaurant, moving slowly$
+down the narrow aisle between the tables, and Timothy stopped talking as$
+they passed and eyed them with a bored interest usual to the$
+circumstances.$
+$
+It was after the interruption had ended, and the last of the little$
+stream had departed, that he saw the card on the table. It was near his$
+place and it had not been there before. He picked it up and on the$
+uppermost side was written: ‚M-^@M-^\Do not let your friend see this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began, and turned the card over.$
+$
+It was not written but printed in capital letters:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM ME BY THE TWENTY-NINTH, I BEG OF YOU$
+    THAT YOU WILL GO TO TANGIER AND ENQUIRE AT THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL$
+    FOR A MAN CALLED RAHBAT‚M-^@M-^TA MOOR, WHO WILL LEAD YOU TO ME. I BEG$
+    YOU FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO COME. DID YOU GET THE$
+    MONEY?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy laid the card down and stared at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and reached out her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Tit is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense, Timothy. What is it? Let me see it, please.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Without a word he handed the card to the girl, who read it through in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is that from?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, ‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Obviously,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the reference to the money and the appeal to our$
+relationship‚M-^@M-^Tbut how did it get there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the head waiter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who were those people who went out just now?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They are very well known,‚M-^@M-^] explained the head waiter. ‚M-^@M-^\There was a$
+monsieur, a London theatrical manager, and a madame who was his wife.$
+There was another monsieur, an American writer, and an English monsieur$
+who was in the employment as secretary to a madame who lives at Cap$
+Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, that is the name. She is a widow, _h√©las_! but immensely rich!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy put the card into his pocket. He had said nothing to the girl$
+about Madame Serpilot since they had left London, and for the first time$
+he had some misgivings as to her safety. Yet in truth that sixth sense$
+of his, which had hitherto worked so to his advantage, offered him no$
+warning that the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys happiness was threatened. He was sure that$
+whatever danger the situation held was danger to him personally. He had$
+not seen the English monsieur who was secretary to Madame Serpilot, but$
+then his back had been toward the far end of the room from whence the$
+man came and he had presented no other view than the back of his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a message from Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am going to get to$
+the bottom of this story if I stay in Monte Carlo for the rest of my$
+life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw Mary back to her hotel, went to his room and changed, and just as$
+the Casino was disgorging its tired clients, he walked through the$
+palm-shaded avenue that led to the main road and began his tramp to Cap$
+Martin. To discover a house in this area by daylight, with the aid of a$
+plan, might have been a simple matter‚M-^@M-^Tby night it presented almost$
+insuperable difficulties.$
+$
+Cap Martin is a promontory of hill and pine and wild flower. Its roads$
+run at the will of its wealthy residents, and there are lanes and paths$
+and broad roads which are not really broad roads at all, but the private$
+entrances to the wonderful villas in which the district abounds, and the$
+grey light was in the eastern sky when Timothy finally located the Villa$
+Condamine.$
+$
+It stood on the edge of the sea, surrounded on the land side by a high$
+wall, though if its owner sought seclusion the woods which surrounded$
+the villa were sufficient.$
+$
+Timothy worked round a little bay until he commanded a view of the place$
+from the sea. A zig-zag path led down from the house to the seashore,$
+terminating in a little concrete quay. Presently he heard the sound of$
+footsteps and a Monogasque workman, in blue overalls, came slouching$
+along the shore path, pipe in mouth.$
+$
+He bade the young man a cheery good morning and stopped, in the friendly$
+way of the Monogasques, to talk. He was a gardener on his way to the$
+villa. He could be on his way to nowhere else, for the rough path on$
+which Timothy stood led straight to a door in the high wall. It was a$
+good job, but he wished he lived nearer. But then, none of madame‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+servants slept in the house, and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! _voil√†!_ It is the Moor!‚M-^@M-^] and he pointed out to sea.$
+$
+A tiny steam yacht was coming slowly to land‚M-^@M-^TTimothy had seen its$
+lights for an hour‚M-^@M-^Tand was steaming now to its anchorage, leaving the$
+line of its wake on the smooth surface of the water.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Moor!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quickly, and then carelessly, ‚M-^@M-^\Has any Moor a$
+villa here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is a great Moor who sometimes$
+comes here from Morocco. A long journey, monsieur. It is five days‚M-^@M-^Y$
+voyage from the Moorish coast‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does he come to the Villa Condamine?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\He is a friend of the madame, and twice has he$
+been there in three months.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was a little splash of water under the bow of the yacht, when the$
+anchor was dropped, and presently a boat drew away and in the stern$
+sheets was a figure muffled in a white jellab.$
+$
+Timothy looked after the retreating figure of the gardener, who was$
+leisurely pursuing his way, and, turning, followed him. It was unlikely$
+that the mysterious madame would allow a humble workman to have the key$
+of the garden gate, yet to his surprise this was the case. The man$
+opened the gate and waited, looking round as if he expected somebody.$
+Timothy guessed that there were two or more workmen and that this$
+particular man had the key and admitted the lot. In this surmise he$
+proved to be right. Presently yet another blue-bloused gardener$
+appeared, and the two stood together waiting for a third. He made no$
+appearance, and the two men passed through the door and pulled it close$
+behind them.$
+$
+Timothy quickened his pace. As he had thought, the door was left ajar$
+for the third man. He pushed it open gently, but saw nothing but the end$
+of a twisting path, which disappeared between high hedges of lilac.$
+$
+If ever there was a time to take a chance it was now; and he was through$
+the gate, gingerly treading the path, before he realised what he had$
+done. He heard voices and moved with caution. Then, after about five$
+minutes, he heard the garden gate behind him bang. The third workman had$
+arrived and the exit was closed. He made his way through the pines which$
+served to screen the house from observation. There was nobody in sight,$
+and the voices had died away. He could walk more boldly now and came at$
+last to the edge of the wood in full view of the villa. Between him and$
+the house was about fifty yards of clear space. He took a chance and$
+crossed it, his objective being a ground-floor window which was open.$
+$
+The entrance was not so easily effected as he had expected. The sill of$
+the window was just above the level of his head, and offered no grip to$
+his hands. He made a tour of reconnaissance, but failed to find any$
+other entrance. Behind the sill, he thought, must be a window frame, and$
+stepping back two paces he made a leap and gripped the frame. Quickly he$
+pulled himself up and dropped into the room.$
+$
+He was conscious of a sweet, fragrant perfume the moment his head became$
+level with the window, and now he saw the explanation. The bare floor$
+was covered three inches thick with rose petals. Evidently the owner$
+made her own perfumery, and this hobby explained the open window. There$
+was no furniture in the room, which was apparently given up to the$
+purpose of drying the petals. The door was unfastened, and he passed$
+into a stone corridor. The structure of the house puzzled him. He did$
+not expect to find himself in the basement; then he remembered that the$
+villa was built on sloping ground, and that the main entrance must be on$
+a higher floor.$
+$
+A flight of stone steps led to the upper level, and he went up$
+cautiously, a step at a time, and found his exit barred by a door which$
+was fastened on the other side with padlock and staple. It was a$
+primitive method of locking up a cellar, and Timothy, remembering that$
+he had passed a recess filled with garden tools, went back to find the$
+means to remove this obstruction. A long chisel prised the staples from$
+the door with ridiculous ease.$
+$
+He heard voices speaking in low, guarded tones and moved along the$
+carpeted hall on tiptoe. He listened at the door of the room from which$
+the voices proceeded, and was in two minds as to what his next step$
+should be. The door was one of two let in the same wall. He stopped and$
+brought his ear to the keyhole of the second and there was no sound.$
+Turning the handle, he looked in.$
+$
+As he expected, it was separated from the other room by a pair of$
+folding doors which were closed. The voices were more distinct but still$
+indistinguishable. He was now in a small drawing-room, well but not$
+luxuriously furnished. Tall French windows led to a loggia, and, what$
+was more important, on either side of these hung long velvet curtains,$
+which might serve, in case of necessity, as a place of concealment.$
+$
+He heard the door of the next room open, and the voices proceeded along$
+the passage. Then the handle of his own door turned. He had just time to$
+slip behind the curtains before somebody entered. It was a woman, and at$
+the sound of her voice he nearly jumped. She was speaking to somebody in$
+the passage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He has gone to his room,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Have your breakfast. He will want$
+you to go into Monte Carlo this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\By daylight?‚M-^@M-^] said the person to whom she spoke, and again Timothy$
+recognised the voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He would not know you with those spectacles. Besides, you had a$
+moustache when you saw him before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man in the passage mumbled something, and Timothy heard the door of$
+the room close. There was a desk, he had noticed, against the blank wall$
+of the room, and it was to this she made her way. He heard the$
+scratching of her pen on paper, then he walked from his place of$
+concealment. Her back was to him and she did not hear him until his$
+shadow fell across the table. Then, with a little cry, she leapt up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good morning, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XXI$
+$
+$
+SADIE MAXELL was as white as the paper on which she had been writing.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you get in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy did not answer. He stepped round so that he was between the$
+woman and the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where is Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to know of him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lower your voice, if you please,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What is$
+Cartwright to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She licked her dry lips before she spoke. Then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I married Cartwright or Benson in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tyears ago,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+Timothy took a step back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You married Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said incredulously. ‚M-^@M-^\That explains why you$
+came away?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was looking at him steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it wanted any explanation‚M-^@M-^Tyes,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to$
+do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going after the man you have upstairs, the fake Moor, who came into$
+this house half an hour ago, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to hand him to justice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before he knew what had happened, she gripped him by his coat with both$
+hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are not going to do anything of the kind, Mr. ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said between her teeth, and her voice trembled with$
+passion. ‚M-^@M-^\I hated him once, but that was before I knew him. I would$
+sooner see you dead as the other man died than that you should bring him$
+more trouble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let me go,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, trying to press loose her hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll leave this house and forget that you were ever here. Oh, you$
+fool, you fool!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had wrenched himself clear of her and flung her backward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have a few words to say to your friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I think you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better stay here whilst I‚M-^@M-^Ym saying them. I hate having family quarrels$
+in public, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had not heard the door open behind him and it was the ‚M-^@M-^\swish‚M-^@M-^] of the$
+loaded cane which warned him. It did not strike him fair on the head, as$
+was intended, but caught him a glancing blow and he fell on his knees,$
+turning his face to his attacker. He knew it was Brown even before the$
+blow fell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I settle him?‚M-^@M-^] said a voice as the stick went up again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no!‚M-^@M-^] cried the woman, ‚M-^@M-^\for God‚M-^@M-^Ys sake, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was at that moment that Timothy low-tackled his assailant. Brown$
+tried to strike, but he was too late and went crashing to the floor, his$
+head against the wall. He made one effort to rise, and then with a groan$
+collapsed.$
+$
+Timothy rose, shaking himself and rubbing his bruised shoulder. Without$
+a word, and with only a look at the woman, he made for the door and$
+banged it in her face. His head was swimming as he made his way up the$
+stairs, swaying at every step. From the broad landing at the top led$
+three doors, only one of which was closed. He turned the handle and went$
+in.$
+$
+A man was standing by the window, which overlooked the calm expanse of$
+ocean, glittering in the light of the rising sun. From shoulder to heel$
+he was clad in a long white mantle and a dark blue turban encircled his$
+head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\you and I will settle accounts.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man had not moved at the sound of the voice, but when Timothy had$
+finished he turned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My God!‚M-^@M-^] cried Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\TIMOTHY,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary, ‚M-^@M-^\I was just thinking about that beautiful house$
+you took me to see at Cap Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Were you, dear?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy without any show of interest.$
+$
+They were on the cross-Channel boat and Boulogne was astern.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you know, I had a feeling that you had taken$
+me there to show me to somebody, some friend of yours perhaps. All the$
+time I was walking about the garden I had a sense of being watched. It$
+is not an uncomfortable sensation, but just that overlooked feeling one$
+has sometimes. I love Monte Carlo. Do you think we shall go back there$
+after‚M-^@M-^Tafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is likely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl rose and went forward along the deck to get a view of a passing$
+destroyer. Timothy took a letter from his pocket and read it for about$
+the twentieth time. It was undated and began:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MY DEAR ANDERSON,‚M-^@M-^TI cannot tell you how grateful I am to you$
+    for your kindness and for the big, generous sympathy you have$
+    shown me. Especially am I glad that you brought Mary so that I$
+    could see her again, for I just hungered for a sight of the$
+    child. Won‚M-^@M-^Yt you please forgive Sadie? She acted without my$
+    knowledge but in my interests, as she thought, in trying to keep$
+    you away from Monte Carlo after she had planned to bring the$
+    girl so that I could see her.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I killed Cartwright, but I shot him in self-defence. His$
+    body lies at the bottom of a disused well in the garden of my$
+    house. It is perfectly true that I had been associated in$
+    business with him and that I was in his Moorish syndicate and$
+    heavily involved. I was so very deeply involved at one time, and$
+    so near to ruin that, deceived by some statement which had been$
+    made to Sadie‚M-^@M-^Ys fortune, I made her acquaintance and married$
+    her. During the past year I have never ceased to thank God that$
+    I did so, for she had been the most loyal companion and friend$
+    that a man could desire.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\It was I who fired the shot through my own window. I$
+    contemplated flight from Cartwright, and was manufacturing$
+    evidence against him in advance‚M-^@M-^TGod forgive me. Sadie guessed,$
+    and when she watched me drawing from the well the bag containing$
+    proof that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys charge was not wholly false, she knew$
+    the end was near.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I am perfectly happy, and spend most of my time developing my$
+    property in Morocco, under the protection of El Mograb, an old$
+    Moorish friend of mine, and the supreme protection of the$
+    Sultan, who, as the Pretender, received considerable help from$
+    me. I am six months of the year with Sadie, for Sadie either$
+    lives on the Riviera or at Cadiz and is easily reachable in my$
+    hired yacht.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I think it best for all concerned, and especially for our dear$
+    Mary, that I remain as dead. Some day the whole story may be$
+    told, but no useful purpose would be served by publishing it$
+    to-day. The card with the message was intended for her, but I am$
+    glad that it fell into your hands. As you guessed, it was I who$
+    flung Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys money into your room‚M-^@M-^TI dared not post it to her$
+    for fear I was betrayed by my writing, and I knew that you were$
+    safe. God bless you both and bring you happiness and prosperity,$
+    to which I hope this property of mine will one day contribute.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy folded the letter and was putting it in his pocket, then changed$
+his mind and took it out. He read it again, then tore it into pieces and$
+flung it over the side of the ship.$
+$
+Then he too went forward to the wife he had married in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tmuch$
+against the wishes of a scandalised Mrs. Renfrew‚M-^@M-^Twho nevertheless$
+termed it ‚M-^@M-^\a pretty romance‚M-^@M-^] in the article she wrote for the _Bath$
+County Herald_.$

+$
+$
+    A Wonder for$
+    Wise Men$
+    By$
+    Wallace B. Nichols$
+$
+    THOUGH an historical romance, this book is much more than$
+    that, for its theme touches present-day ideas in a remarkable$
+    manner, especially as concerns the hideous uselessness of war.$
+    It is set in the reign of Henry VII and deals with the aftermath$
+    of the Wars of the Roses. The principal character becomes one of$
+    the King‚M-^@M-^Ys most trusted instruments in the founding of modern$
+    England, and the story marches to an emotional and uplifting$
+    close. This is an historical novel where the characters are not$
+    puppets of impossible romance, but living human beings as real$
+    as the people about us every day.$

+$
+    SECRET MARKET$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This is a first novel by one of our younger poets, and it is a$
+    novel which equally plainly shows him to be an artist. The plot$
+    is cleverly developed, and the story ends at once dramatically$
+    and artistically.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The Glasgow Herald._$
+$
+    BRITTLE GLORY$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Wallace B. Nichols deserves congratulation. He has demonstrated$
+    a capacity for expression, in terms of strength, beauty and$
+    sincerity, through two mediums. It is an uncommon book with an$
+    outstanding quality: it never ceases to be readable.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The$
+    Observer._$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Nichols has all the gifts of a great novelist: an unerring sense$

+    Mr. Fortune$
+    Explains$
+    By$
+    H. C. Bailey$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MR. FORTUNE‚M-^@M-^] has long since established himself as one of the$
+    brightest stars in the galaxy of modern crime detectives. He$
+    works on the friendliest terms with Scotland Yard, but his$
+    methods‚M-^@M-^Tand incidentally his manners‚M-^@M-^Tare peculiarly his own.$
+    Here we have a series of the most widely divergent mysteries$
+    successively solved by a bland, imperturbable middle-aged$
+    gentleman whose sole concern in life appears to be that he shall$
+    not miss his lunch or any other comfort that is due to him. No$
+    one who has read other ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Fortune‚M-^@M-^] volumes will on any account$
+    miss this, while those who have yet to make the dear man‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+    acquaintance are to be envied for the joy that awaits them.$

+              Mr. Fortune Speaking   My Lady of Orange, etc.$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   Mr. H. C. Bailey is not only a master in the realm of historic$
+    romance, but in that of the mystery story as well: in fact, he is$
+    easily one of the best and most logical of all the many writers of$
+    the detective story to-day.$

+    The Subway$
+    Mystery$
+    By$
+    Ben Bolt$
+$
+    ONE would think it impossible for anybody to walk down into$
+    the crowded new Piccadilly Circus Tube Station and there be$
+    swiftly murdered without immediate discovery of the assassin.$
+    But from the slenderest of clues the whole failure of a great$
+    vengeance is discovered, and Mr. Ben Bolt has provided in his$
+    new story a series of situations and adventures that would keep$
+    the sleepiest reader agog for the end.$

+$
+    ADMIRERS of ‚M-^@M-^\Wee Macgreegor‚M-^@M-^] and kindred works will be$
+    interested to see what the talented author makes of a more$
+    ambitious theme. Subtle characterization is here combined with$
+    the thrills of an Armada treasure hunt, complicated by the$
+    misunderstandings and perplexities of three widely divergent$
+    love affairs. The scenes are laid partly in Spain, partly in the$
+    Western Isles, and what with bloodstained daggers, mysterious$
+    scraps of parchment, buried caskets, plotting priests,$
+    mysterious garden-haunting strangers, and speedy motor-boats,$
+    the reader is kept constantly guessing.$

+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of$

+computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It$
+exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations$

+goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will$

+Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure$
+and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future$
+generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see$

+Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg$
+Literary Archive Foundation$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide$
+spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of$
+increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be$
+freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest$
+array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations$
+($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt$
+status with the IRS.$
+$
+The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating$
+charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United$
+States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a$
+considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up$
+with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations$
+where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND$
+DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular$
+state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we$
+have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition$
+against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who$
+approach us with offers to donate.$
+$
+International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make$
+any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from$
+outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.$
+$
+Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation$
+methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other$
+ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To$
+donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.$
+$
+Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project$
+Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be$
+freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and$
+distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of$
+volunteer support.$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed$
+editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in$
+the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not$
+necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper$
+edition.$
+$
+Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search$
+facility: www.gutenberg.org$
+$
+This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,$
+including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to$
+subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.$

+                               CHAPTER I$
+$
+$
+IT was two hours after the muezzin had called to evening prayer, and$
+night had canopied Tangier with a million stars. In the little Sok, the$
+bread-sellers sat cross-legged behind their wares, their candles burning$
+steadily, for there was not so much as the whisper of a wind blowing.$
+The monotonous strumming of a guitar from a Moorish caf√©, the agonised$
+_barlak!_ of a belated donkey-driver bringing his charge down the steep$
+streets which lead to the big bazaar, the shuffle of bare feet on$
+Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys cobbles, and the distant hush-hush of the rollers breaking$
+upon the amber shore‚M-^@M-^Tthese were the only sounds which the night held.$
+$
+John Maxell sat outside the Continental Caf√©, in the condition of bodily$
+content which a good dinner induces. Mental content should have$
+accompanied such a condition, but even the memory of a perfect dinner$
+could not wholly obliterate a certain uneasiness of mind. He had been$
+uneasy when he came to Tangier, and his journey through France and Spain$
+had been accompanied by certain apprehensions and doubts which$
+Cartwright had by no means dispelled.$
+$
+Rather, by his jovial evasions, his cheery optimism, and at times his$
+little irritable outbreaks of temper, he had given the eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Counsel further cause for disquiet.$
+$
+Cartwright sat at the other side of the table, and was unusually quiet.$
+This was a circumstance which was by no means displeasing to Maxell, for$
+the night was not conducive to talk. There are in Northern Africa many$
+nights like this, when one wishes to sit in dead silence and let thought$
+take its own course, unchecked and untrammelled. In Morocco such nights$
+are common and, anyway, Maxell had always found it difficult to discuss$
+business matters after dinner.$
+$
+Cartwright had no temperament and his quiet was due to other causes. It$
+was he who broke the silence, knocking out his pipe on the iron-topped$
+table with a clang which jarred his more sensitive companion to the very$
+spine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd stake my life and my soul on there being a reef,‚M-^@M-^] he said with a$
+suddenness which was almost as jarring. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, you‚M-^@M-^Yve seen the outcrop$
+for yourself, and isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it exactly the same formation as you see on the$
+Rand?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell nodded.$
+$
+Though a common-law man, he had been associated in mining cases and had$
+made a very careful study of the whole problem of gold extraction.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It looks right enough to me,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but as against that we have the$
+fact that some clever engineers have spent a great deal of time and$
+money trying to locate the reef. That there is gold in Morocco everybody$
+knows, and I should say, Cartwright, that you are right. But where is$
+the reef? It would cost a fortune to bore, even though we had the other$
+borings to guide us.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other made an impatient noise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if the reef were all mapped out it would be a simple matter,$
+but then we shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt get on to it, as we are to-day, at the cost of a$
+few thousands. Hang it all, Maxell, we‚M-^@M-^Yve got to take a certain amount$
+of risk! I know it‚M-^@M-^Ys a gamble quite as well as you. There‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+arguing that point with me. But other things are gambles too. Law was a$
+gamble to you for many years, and a bigger gamble after you took silk.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was a sore point with Maxell, as the other knew. A prosperous$
+junior, he had been called within the Bar, and taken upon himself the$
+function and style of King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsellor in the hope that his prosperity$
+would still further be expanded. And, like so many other men, he had$
+discovered that the successful junior is not necessarily the successful$
+K.C.$
+$
+Fortunately for him, he had long before contested and won a seat in$
+Parliament, and his service to the Government of the day had to some$
+extent ensured his future. But, financially, he had suffered$
+considerably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\silk isn‚M-^@M-^Yt any great catch to a man, I agree; and it was$
+certainly a gamble, and a losing gamble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Which reminds me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there was a talk, before I left$
+London, that you would be given Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is extremely unlikely,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Anyway, if they make me$
+Solicitor-General, that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt carry Cabinet rank.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It carries a lot of money,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright after a pause for a moment,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and it‚M-^@M-^Ys money that counts just now, Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the lawyer nodded.$
+$
+He might have added that, but for the need for money, he would long$
+since have dropped his association with Alfred Cartwright, though$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood very high in certain circles of the City of$
+London. They had been at school together, though in that period there$
+had been no very great friendship between them. And Cartwright was$
+marked out for success from the beginning. He inherited a considerable$
+business when his father died, and he enlarged and improved upon it. He$
+had taken up a hundred and one outside interests, and had made most of$
+them pay. A few of them did not pay, and it was whispered that the$
+losses upon his failures took a considerable slice of the balance that$
+accrued from his successes.$
+$
+They had met again when Maxell was a junior and Cartwright the defendant$
+in a case which, had he lost, would have made him some thirty thousand$
+pounds the poorer. When Maxell thought back upon that event, he had to$
+confess that it was not a pleasant case, being one in which Cartwright$
+had been charged with something which was tantamount to$
+misrepresentation; and, although he had won, and won brilliantly, he had$
+never felt any great pride in his achievement.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] he said (the pauses were frequent and long), ‚M-^@M-^\I should hardly$
+imagine that the Prime Minister loves me to that extent. In Parliament$
+you have to be an uncomfortable quantity to be really successful. You$
+must be strong enough to have a national following, and sufficiently$
+independent to keep the Whips guessing. I am known as a safe man, and I$
+hold a safe seat, which I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose if I tried. That doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt make$
+for promotion. Of course, I could have had an Under-Secretaryship for$
+the asking, and that means a couple of thousand a year, but it also$
+means that you last out the life of the administration in a subordinate$
+capacity, and that, by the time you have made good, your party is in the$
+cold shade of opposition, and there are no jobs going.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head, and returned immediately to the question of the$
+missing reef, as though he wished to take the subject from his own$
+personal affairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You say that it would cost us a lot of money if the reef was proved,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it costing us a lot now?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is. As a matter of fact,‚M-^@M-^] he confessed, ‚M-^@M-^\the actual reef is$
+costing nothing, or next to nothing, because El Mograb is helping me. In$
+our own business‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, in the Syndicate‚M-^@M-^Tour expenses are$
+more or less small; but I am doing a little independent buying, and that$
+has meant the spending of money. I am taking up all the ground to the$
+south of the Angera‚M-^@M-^Ta pretty expensive business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is rather worrying me, you know, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\your$
+scheme is ever so much too ambitious. I was figuring it out this$
+afternoon as I was sitting in my room, and I came to the conclusion$
+that, if the scheme as you outlined it to me yesterday went through, it$
+would mean your finding two millions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Three,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the other cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\but think what it means,$
+Maxell! Supposing it went through. Supposing we struck a reef, and the$
+reef continued, as I believe it will, through the country I am taking$
+up! Why, it may mean a hundred millions to me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other sighed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have reached the point where I think a hundred thousand is an$
+enormous sum,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\However, you know your own business best,$
+Cartwright. But I want to be satisfied in the matter in which we are$
+associated together, that my liability does not exceed my power to pay.$
+And there is another matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright guessed the ‚M-^@M-^\other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was looking over your titles this afternoon,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\and I see$
+no reference to the old Spanish working. I remember that you told me a$
+Spaniard had taken up a considerable stretch of country and had$
+exhausted his capital trying to prove the reef‚M-^@M-^TSe√±or Brigot, wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+that his name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded curtly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A drunkard‚M-^@M-^Tand a bad lot,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\His moral character doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt count so far as the details go; what does$
+matter is that if your theory is correct, the reef must run through his$
+property. What are you going to do about that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Buy him out,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+He rose abruptly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym walking up to the Sok,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Come along?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They tramped up the long, steep hill-street together, and they did not$
+speak till they had passed through the ancient gate into the unrelieved$
+gloom which lies outside the city.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand you, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tyou take an old man‚M-^@M-^Ys view of things,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said Cartwright irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre comparatively young, you‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+good-looker. Why the devil don‚M-^@M-^Yt you marry, and marry money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you ever tried to marry money?‚M-^@M-^] he asked dryly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said the other after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\but I should think it is pretty$
+simple.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try it,‚M-^@M-^] said the laconic Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\It is simple in books, but in real$
+life it is next to impossible. I go about a great deal in society of all$
+kinds, and I can tell you that I have never yet met an eligible spinster$
+with money‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, large money. I agree with you,‚M-^@M-^] he went on$
+after a while, ‚M-^@M-^\a man like myself should marry. And he should marry$
+well. I could give a woman a good position, but she‚M-^@M-^Ys got to be the$
+right kind of woman. There are some times when I‚M-^@M-^Ym just frantic about my$
+position. I am getting older‚M-^@M-^TI am forty-seven next birthday‚M-^@M-^Tand every$
+day that slips past is a day lost. I ought to be married, but I can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+afford a wife. It is a blackguardly thing to talk about money in$
+connection with marriage and yet somehow I can think of nothing$
+else‚M-^@M-^Twhenever the thought arises in my mind I see an imaginary beauty$
+sitting on a big bag of gold!‚M-^@M-^] He chuckled to himself. ‚M-^@M-^\Let‚M-^@M-^Ys go back,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the big Sok always gives me the creeps.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Something lumbered past him in the darkness, some big, overpowering$
+beast with an unpleasant smell, and a guttural voice cried in Arabic:$
+‚M-^@M-^\Beware!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Camels!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright briefly. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre bringing in the stuff for$
+the morning market. The night‚M-^@M-^Ys young yet, Maxell. Let us go up to the$
+theatre.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt even know the theatre was open.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is called theatre by courtesy,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\the$
+inhabitants refer to it as the circus. It‚M-^@M-^Ys a big wooden place on the$
+sea edge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know it, I know it,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\What is being played? The only$
+people I have ever seen there have been Spanish artistes‚M-^@M-^Tand pretty bad$
+artistes, too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, there‚M-^@M-^Ys a treat for you. It is an English company, or rather, a$
+variety company with a number of English turns,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\We$
+might do worse‚M-^@M-^Tat least, I might,‚M-^@M-^] he added ominously.$
+$
+When they reached the theatre they found it sparsely filled. Cartwright$
+took one of the open boxes, and his companion settled himself into a$
+corner to smoke. The turns were of the kind which are usually to be met$
+with on the Levant; a tawdrily attired lady sang a humorous song in$
+Spanish, the humour being frankly indecent. There were a juggler and a$
+man with performing dogs, and then ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^] was announced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, turning to the programme.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may even be Irish,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell dryly.$
+$
+The wheezy little orchestra played a few bars and the girl came on. She$
+was pretty‚M-^@M-^Tthere was no doubt about that‚M-^@M-^Tand of a prettiness which$
+satisfied both men. She was also British or American, for the song she$
+sang was in a French with which both men were familiar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is horrible to see an English girl in a place like this and in such$
+company,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder where she‚M-^@M-^Ys staying,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, half to himself, and a$
+contemptuous little smile curled Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going to rescue her from her infamous surroundings?‚M-^@M-^] he asked,$
+and Cartwright snapped round on him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wish to heaven you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic, Maxell. That‚M-^@M-^Ys twice this$
+evening‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, snicking off the ash of his cigar. ‚M-^@M-^\I am in a$
+cynical mood to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He raised his hands to applaud the girl as she bowed herself from the$
+stage, and glanced round the house. Three boxes away was a small party$
+of men, whom he judged were the sons of prosperous members of the$
+Spanish colony. Their fingers flashed with diamonds, their cigarettes$
+burnt from jewelled holders. Cartwright followed the direction of the$
+other‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys made a hit, that Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\These fellows will be$
+tumbling over one another to present her with verbal bouquets. I wonder$
+where she lives!‚M-^@M-^] he said again.$
+$
+Presently the young men rose in a body and left the box, and Cartwright$
+grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you mind hanging on here whilst I go outside?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a bit,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\Where are you off to? To find out where$
+she lives?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you go again,‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I think Tangier makes you$
+liverish.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When he had got to the promenade, the men had disappeared, but a$
+question directed to the head attendant revealed, as he had expected,$
+the objective of the little party at the stage door.$
+$
+The stage door was reached from the outside of the theatre and involved$
+a journey over rubble and brick heaps. Presently he came to an open$
+doorway, where sat a solitary half-caste smoking a pipe and reading an$
+old _Heraldo_.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, _hombre_,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in Spanish, ‚M-^@M-^\have you seen my three$
+friends come in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] nodded the man; ‚M-^@M-^\they have just entered.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He indicated the direction, which lay through a dark and smelly passage.$
+$
+Cartwright walked along this stuffy hallway, and, turning the corner,$
+came upon an interesting group gathered about a closed door, against$
+which one, and the least sober, of the party was hammering. Near by$
+stood a small, stout man in soiled evening dress, grinning his approval,$
+and it was clear that the visitors were at once known and welcome.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open the door, my dream of joy,‚M-^@M-^] hiccupped the young man, hammering at$
+the panel. ‚M-^@M-^\We have come to bring you homage and adoration‚M-^@M-^Ttell her to$
+open the door, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he addressed the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, and$
+the small man minced forward and spoke in English.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is all right, my dear. Some friends of mine wish to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A voice inside, which Cartwright recognised, answered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not see them. Tell them to go away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You hear?‚M-^@M-^] said the manager, shrugging his shoulders. ‚M-^@M-^\She will not see$
+you. Now go back to your seats and let me persuade her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or!‚M-^@M-^] He raised his eyebrows to the unexpected apparition of$
+Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you doing here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is forbidden to enter the theatre through the saloon of artistes,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the small man pompously. ‚M-^@M-^\If Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your friend, you must$
+wait for her until the performance is over.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright took no notice. He was a tall man of athletic build and$
+shouldering his way past the others with no difficulty, he tapped on the$
+panel.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\here is an English visitor wants to see you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\English?‚M-^@M-^] said the voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Come in for the love of Mike!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The door was opened, and a girl with a silk kimono pulled over her stage$
+dress, offered him a smiling welcome. The young Spaniard who had been$
+hammering on the panel of the door would have followed, but Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+arm barred him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want this fellow?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do I want him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady bitterly, ‚M-^@M-^\do I want the scarlet$
+fever or measles? You bet I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want him. He‚M-^@M-^Ys been pestering me ever$
+since I‚M-^@M-^Yve been here.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you hear what the lady says?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, speaking in Spanish.$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does not desire your acquaintance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My father owns this theatre,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man loudly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then he‚M-^@M-^Ys got a rotten property,‚M-^@M-^] replied the calm Cartwright.$
+$
+The Spaniard turned in a rage to his soiled satellite.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You will put this man out at once, Jose, or there will be trouble for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little man shrugged his helplessness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said in English, ‚M-^@M-^\you see my unhappy position. The se√±or is$
+the son of my proprietor and it will be bad for me if you stay. I ask$
+you as a friend and caballero to go at once and spare me misfortune.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright looked at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Must you go on again in this infernal place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, laughter and admiration in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens if you chuck this infernal job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym fired,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve a ten weeks‚M-^@M-^Y contract with these$
+people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you get?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two hundred and fifty pesetas a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+wonderful salary, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How many more weeks have you to go before your contract is finished?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another four,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\we‚M-^@M-^Yre playing in Cadiz next week, in Seville$
+the week after, then Malaga, then Granada.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you like it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like it!‚M-^@M-^] the scorn in her voice was her answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The dresses belong to the troupe, I guess,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Get into your$
+street clothes and I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, eyeing him narrowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good your lost contract,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an English girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Irish,‚M-^@M-^] she corrected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean Irish,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like to see an Irish girl doing$
+this kind of thing with a lot of horrible half-breeds. You‚M-^@M-^Yve talent$
+enough for London or Paris. What about Paris? I know any number of$
+people there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Could you get me a good engagement?‚M-^@M-^] she asked eagerly.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys your name, anyway?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never mind about my name. Smith, Brown, Jones, Robinson‚M-^@M-^Tanything you$
+like.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was the agitated little manager who interfered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you must not persuade this lady to leave the theatre. I$
+have her under heavy penalties. I can bring her before the judge‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now just forget that!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\there is no judge in Tangier.$
+She is a British subject, and the most you can do is to take her before$
+the British Consul.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When she returns to Spain‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] said the little man growing apoplectic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She will not return to Spain. She will go to Gibraltar if she goes$
+anywhere,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and from Gibraltar she will be on the sea$
+until she reaches a British port.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will go to the Spanish Consul,‚M-^@M-^] screamed the little manager, clawing$
+the air. ‚M-^@M-^\I will not be robbed. You shall not interfere with my$
+business, you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Much of this, thought Cartwright, was intended for the glowering young$
+Spaniard who stood in the background. He went outside, closed the door$
+and stood with his back toward it. On a whispered instruction from his$
+employer‚M-^@M-^Ys son, whose hands were now flickering fire as he gesticulated$
+in his excitement, Jose the manager disappeared, and returned a few$
+minutes later with two stalwart stage hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Will you leave this theatre at once and quietly?‚M-^@M-^] demanded the foaming$
+manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will not leave the theatre until I am ready,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+if I leave otherwise, I shall certainly not leave quietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The manager stood back with a melodramatic gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eject the caballero,‚M-^@M-^] he said finely.$
+$
+The two men hesitated. Then one came forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The se√±or must leave,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In good time, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+A hand gripped his arm, but instantly he had shaken free, and had driven$
+with all his strength at the man‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw. The stage hand dropped like a$
+log. He pushed at the door behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put your kimono over your things,‚M-^@M-^] he said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\You can send the$
+stage kit back to-morrow. There is going to be a rough house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All right,‚M-^@M-^] said a voice behind him, and the girl slipped out, still in$
+her kimono and carrying a bundle of clothes under her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know the way out? I‚M-^@M-^Yll follow you. Now, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he said flippantly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going‚M-^@M-^Tquietly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER II$
+$
+$
+HE left behind him a pandemonium of sound and a scintillation of$
+flickering diamonds. He found the girl waiting for him in the darkness.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Br-r-r! It‚M-^@M-^Ys cold!‚M-^@M-^] she shivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you staying?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the little hotel opposite the British Consulate,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt much of a place, but it was the only room I could get‚M-^@M-^Tat the$
+price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better not go there,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll send for your boxes in the$
+morning. Give me those clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took them from her and put them under his arm, and she fell in by his$
+side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad to be out of it,‚M-^@M-^] she said breathlessly, taking his arm;$
+‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a dog‚M-^@M-^Ys life. I was going to quit to-morrow. Those boys have been$
+following me round ever since I came to Tangier. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better go back to my hotel, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a moment; ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+pretty tough crowd, these Spaniards, and though I don‚M-^@M-^Yt understand their$
+beastly language, I know just what kind of happy holiday they‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+planning for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were in the town, passing up the street of the mosque, when she$
+asked him:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you taking me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the Continental,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Like this?‚M-^@M-^] she said in dismay, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have an office in this street,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\you can go in and dress.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for you outside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He showed her into the tiny room which served as the headquarters of the$
+Angera Gold Mining Syndicate, and sat on the irregular stone steps,$
+waiting until she was dressed. Presently she came out, a presentable and$
+an attractive figure.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just thought,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you had better to go the$
+Central‚M-^@M-^TI am staying at the Continental and it wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt look nice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been thinking something of the sort myself,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What about$
+my broken engagement? Were you joking when you said you would pay? I$
+hate talking about money, but I am broke‚M-^@M-^TJose owes me a week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good the money to-morrow,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I can give you a tenner$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the idea?‚M-^@M-^] she asked him again. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve read a lot of books, and$
+I know the knight errant business backwards. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt strike me as$
+being a something-for-nothing man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\It occurred to me when I saw you on the$
+stage, that you might be useful. I want a person in Paris I can$
+trust‚M-^@M-^Tsomebody who could look after my interests.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a business woman,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I hate business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Business is done by men,‚M-^@M-^] said he significantly. ‚M-^@M-^\And there are a few$
+men I want you to keep track of. Do you understand that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see,‚M-^@M-^] she said at last. ‚M-^@M-^\It is better than I thought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He did not trouble to ask her what she had thought, or what she imagined$
+he had planned, but saw her into the hotel, arranged for a room, and$
+walked slowly back to the Continental. He was in the vestibule of that$
+hotel before he remembered that he had left an eminent King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel$
+and Member of Parliament smoking his cigar in a _loge_ of the Tangier$
+circus.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I missed you,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell the next morning. ‚M-^@M-^\When you remembered and$
+came to pick me up, I was on my way back‚M-^@M-^Twe must have passed somewhere$
+in the little Sok. What happened last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing much,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\I went round and saw the girl.$
+She was very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How amusing?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, just amusing.‚M-^@M-^] Vaguely: ‚M-^@M-^\I found her annoyed by the attention which$
+was being paid to her by a veritable Spanish hidalgo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you sailed in and rescued her, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\And what happened$
+to her after she was rescued?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I saw her home to her hotel, and there the matter ended. By the way,$
+she leaves by the _Gibel Musa_ for Gibraltar this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] Maxell looked absently at the letter he had in his hand, folded it$
+and put it away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is the mail in?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright, interested, and Maxell nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve had your daily letter from your kiddie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is not a baby letter, but it is very amusing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How old is she?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She must be nine or ten,‚M-^@M-^] said the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is just coincidence, or whether it is fate,‚M-^@M-^] mused$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is a coincidence?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve got a kid to look after, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym in a sort of way$
+responsible for a bright lad. Mine is less interesting than yours, I$
+think. Anyway, he‚M-^@M-^Ys a boy and a sort of cousin. He has two fool parents$
+who were born to slavery‚M-^@M-^Tthe sort of people who are content to work for$
+somebody all their lives and regard revolt against their condition as an$
+act of impiety. I‚M-^@M-^Yve only seen the kid once, and he struck me as the$
+sort who might break loose from that kind of life and take a chance.$
+Otherwise, I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have interested myself in him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How far does your interest extend?‚M-^@M-^] asked Maxell curiously. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not$
+the sort of person, I should imagine, who would take up the unfortunate$
+poor as a hobby.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a something-for-nothing man, in fact,‚M-^@M-^] laughed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been told that twice in twenty-four hours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who was the other person‚M-^@M-^Tthe actress?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright roared with laughter and slapped the other on the knee.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No, I am not a something-for-nothing$
+person. I‚M-^@M-^Ym one of those optimists who plant fir cones so that I shall$
+have some good firewood for my old age. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what sort of a man$
+Timothy will make, but, as I say, he shapes good, and anyway, you and I$
+are in the same boat.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except this,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\that from what you say, you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+particularly interested in your prot√©g√©, and you don‚M-^@M-^Yt really care$
+whether he shapes good or shapes bad.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys true,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an experiment.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little girl is something more than that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell quietly;$
+‚M-^@M-^\she‚M-^@M-^Ys the only living thing I have any real affection for‚M-^@M-^Tshe is my$
+dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your niece, eh? Well, that gives you an interest which I have not. I$
+never had a niece and I should just hate to be called uncle, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Their conversation was interrupted at this point by the arrival of a$
+small man dressed in his best clothes. On his brow was a frown which was$
+intended to be terrible, but was slightly amusing. Jose Ferreira had$
+dressed and prepared himself for an interview which, as he had described$
+to his friends, could not fail to be at once ‚M-^@M-^\terrifying and vital.‚M-^@M-^]$
+For, as he had said: ‚M-^@M-^\This man has sliced my life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He began his speech to Cartwright as he had rehearsed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Estoy indignado‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T_‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright cut him short with an expression of mock fear.$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Horroroso!_ You are indignant, are you? Well, come, little man, and$
+tell me why you are indignant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] said the man solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\you have put upon me a humiliation and$
+a shame which all my life I shall regret.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The conversation was in Spanish, but Maxell was an excellent Spanish$
+scholar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, before Jose, still labouring under the$
+sense of his wrongs, could get going again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen to him and discover,‚M-^@M-^] mocked Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have taken from his$
+incomparable company its joy and its gem.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In other words, the amiable Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, yes, se√±or,‚M-^@M-^] broke in Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\For me it is ruin! The money I have$
+spent to make my company perfect! It is financed by one who is the$
+greatest man in Tangier and it is his son who tells me that, unless I$
+bring back this lady‚M-^@M-^Tfor me there is the street and the gutter,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+wept.$
+$
+Maxell looked slyly at his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys another chance for you to plant a fir cone,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Can‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+you find some use for this gentleman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But Cartwright was not smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] he said crisply, ‚M-^@M-^\you are, as all Spain knows, a thief$
+and a rogue. If you associate with bigger thieves and bigger scoundrels,$
+that is your business. I can only tell you that you may think yourself$
+lucky I did not bring this case before the Spanish Consul. I assure you,$
+you would never have put your foot in Tangier again after the stories I$
+have heard about you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The little Spaniard was open-mouthed and impressed. He was also a little$
+frightened. Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation had been at a venture, but he argued$
+that it was scarcely likely that, in an establishment of the description$
+which Mr. Ferreira controlled, there could have been no incidents which$
+reflected upon the manager.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything which is said about me is a lie!‚M-^@M-^] said the little man$
+vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I have lived a life of the highest virtue! To-day I$
+complain to the British Consul, and we shall see!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Complain,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This chance I will give you.‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Ferreira wagged a fat, stumpy$
+finger. ‚M-^@M-^\Restore to me Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and the matter shall go no$
+farther.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady has left Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] said the other calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\so it is clear$
+to you that I cannot restore her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She has not left,‚M-^@M-^] vociferated the Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\We had a man to watch the$
+boat leaving for the _Gibel Musa_ and she did not leave the pier.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She left the beach,‚M-^@M-^] explained Cartwright patiently; ‚M-^@M-^\she was rowed out$
+by a boatman from the Cecil. At this moment she is half-way to$
+Gibraltar.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira groaned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is ruin for me,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps for you also,‚M-^@M-^] he added$
+ominously. ‚M-^@M-^\I can do no less than depart for Paris to lay this matter$
+before my excellent patron, Se√±or Don‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright jerked his head to the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Get out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and turned his attention to the newspaper which he$
+had picked up from the table.$
+$
+Maxell waited until the little man had gone, still seething with his$
+‚M-^@M-^\indignado,‚M-^@M-^] then turned to Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is rather a serious matter, Cartwright; what has happened to the$
+girl?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you hear? I have sent her to Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt leave a dog in that company. And from Gibraltar she goes home$
+by the first P. & O.,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hm!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you ‚M-^@M-^Xhming‚M-^@M-^Y about?‚M-^@M-^] snarled his companion. ‚M-^@M-^\The girl$
+is gone. I shall not see her again. It was an act of charity. Do you$
+disapprove?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you felt so bad about it. No, I$
+think you‚M-^@M-^Yve done the girl a very good turn. But in these days one$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt expect‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blessed is he that expecteth nothing, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright$
+sententiously, ‚M-^@M-^\for he shall not be disappointed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose that$
+the proprietor, whoever he is, cares a snap of his fingers about the$
+matter‚M-^@M-^Tit is his infernal son who will fire the adorable Jose.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+That afternoon the two men had an interview on the outskirts of the town$
+with a very plainly dressed Moor, who came to them so cautiously that$
+the observers might have been pardoned if they thought he was a$
+criminal. In the eyes of the divine rulers of Morocco he was something$
+more than a criminal, because he was an emissary of El Mograb, the$
+Pretender. There was a price upon the messenger‚M-^@M-^Ys head, and his caution$
+was, therefore, commendable. He brought a letter from El Mograb to$
+Cartwright, and it was a message of cheer.$
+$
+Maxell and his friend had gone out early in the afternoon and had waited$
+two hours under a scorching sun for the courier to arrive. For a man of$
+law, the fact that he was coquetting with the Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy did not$
+distress Maxell, who knew the history of the country too well to worry$
+very much about Sultan or Pretender. The Sultan‚M-^@M-^Ys reign, marked with the$
+turbulence of people and the self-indulgence of monarch, was already$
+doomed. His uncle, El Mograb, a born leader of men and captain of seven$
+thousand well-armed soldiers, was but waiting the psychological moment$
+to strike; and Adbul, with his motor-cars and brass bedstead, his$
+geegaws and his frippery, would disappear into the limbo which is$
+especially reserved for extravagant and unstable rulers.$
+$
+The news from El Mograb was good. It reconfirmed the concession which$
+one of his shereefs had made on his behalf, and sent a message in$
+flowery Arabic‚M-^@M-^Ta message of thanks to the man who had supplied him with$
+the very necessary rifles.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That was news to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright as they rode back to the town. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you were gun-running, Maxell, or that you were so solid with$
+El Mograb.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I like El Mograb,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the many Moors who have$
+impressed me. You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that I have been visiting Morocco since$
+I was a boy and most of the chiefs are known to me personally. I knew El$
+Mograb‚M-^@M-^Ys brother, who was killed at Tetuan, and when he was a favourite$
+in court circles he entertained me at Fez.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his word worth?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is worth all the contracts that ever went to Somerset House for$
+stamping,‚M-^@M-^] said the other with emphasis. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you can go ahead with$
+your scheme.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go back to London and raise the money,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We shall want a$
+couple of millions eventually, but half a million will do to go on with.$
+You had better be with me in the big scheme, Maxell. There is nothing to$
+lose for you. You‚M-^@M-^Yll be in on the ground floor. What is the good of your$
+pottering about with your little Company‚M-^@M-^TI mean the Parent Company?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have faith in that,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\I know just the amount of my$
+indebtedness.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\The big scheme may mean$
+millions to you, and I shall want your help and guidance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell hesitated. The lure was dazzling, the prize was immense. But it$
+meant risks which he was not prepared to take. He knew something of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys financial methods; he had seen them in their working, and$
+had done not a little on one occasion to save Cartwright from the$
+consequences of his own cleverness. Yet, as he argued, Cartwright would$
+have no difficulty in raising the money from the general public, and his$
+presence on the board would certainly be a guarantee against his$
+companion departing from the narrow path.$
+$
+Although it was not generally known that he was associated in any of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises, there had been a whisper of an inquiry in$
+influential quarters, and it had been hinted to him that, on the whole,$
+it would be better if he kept himself aloof from the gentleman who,$
+admirable business man as he was, had a passion for enterprises which$
+occasionally verged upon the illegal. But those influential quarters had$
+not whispered anything in the shape of a definite promise that his$
+welfare was entirely in their keeping and that his future would not be$
+overlooked.$
+$
+He was an ambitious man, but his ambitions ran in realisable directions.$
+The services he had rendered to the Government were such as deserved a$
+recognition, and the only question was what form that recognition would$
+take? His knowledge of languages qualified him for an important$
+appointment under the Foreign Office; but the Foreign Office was a close$
+preserve and difficult to break into. There were too many permanent$
+officials who regarded the service as a family affair, and were jealous$
+of patronage outside their own charmed circle.$
+$
+He went in to lunch that day to find Cartwright reading a telegram which$
+he folded up and put into his pocket upon the other‚M-^@M-^Ys appearance.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My little friend has arrived in Gibraltar,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+Maxell looked at him curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happens now?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym sending her home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys voice was brisk and he spoke in the manner of a man$
+referring to a topic too unimportant to be discussed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^] pursued Maxell, and the other shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have given her a letter of introduction to a friend of mine,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+carelessly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have one or two theatrical interests in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell said nothing, and could have dismissed the matter as lightly as$
+his companion, for the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys future scarcely interested him.$
+$
+She had been but a figure on the stage; her personality, her very$
+appearance, left no definite impression. But if he was not interested in$
+the girl, he was interested in Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private mind. Here was a man$
+of whom he could not know too much. And somehow he felt that he had$
+hardly cracked the surface of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys character though he had known$
+him for years, and though they were working together to a common end.$
+$
+The way of a man with a maid is wonderful, but it is also instructive to$
+the cold-blooded onlooker, who discovers in that way a kind of creature$
+he has never met before; a new man, so entirely different from the$
+familiar being he had met in club or drawing-room as to be almost$
+unrecognisable. And he wanted to know just this side of Cartwright,$
+because it was the side on which he had scarcely any information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you won‚M-^@M-^Yt see her again?‚M-^@M-^] he said, playing with his knife and$
+looking abstractedly out of the window.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt think so,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, and then, with a sudden$
+irritation: ‚M-^@M-^\What the devil are you driving at, Maxell? I may see the$
+girl‚M-^@M-^TI go to music-halls, and it is hardly likely I should miss her.$
+Naturally I am interested in the lady I have rescued from this kind of$
+thing‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The waved his hand vaguely toward Tangier Bay‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and she may be$
+useful. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to say _you‚M-^@M-^Yre_ struck on her?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He tried to carry war into the enemy‚M-^@M-^Ys camp and failed, for Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+blue eyes met his steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know what she looks like,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am not likely to$
+fall in love with a lady who left absolutely no impression upon me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+He left next day on the boat for Cadiz, _en route_ to Paris and London,$
+and he and Cartwright had as a fellow-passenger a shabby little man$
+whose belongings were packed in an American-cloth suit-case inscribed in$
+flourishing capitals, evidently by the owner, ‚M-^@M-^\Jose Ferreira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ferreira spent most of his time on the ship‚M-^@M-^Ys deck, biting his nails$
+and enlarging his grievance against the unconscious Cartwright.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER III$
+$
+$
+MAXELL did not stay many hours in Paris. The Sud Express landed him in$
+the French capital at seven in the morning. He left Paris by the midday$
+train for London. The Long Vacation was drawing to an end, and there$
+were briefs of certain importance requiring examination. There was also$
+a consultation with the Attorney-General on an interpretation of a$
+clause in the new Shipping Act, and he was also due to address his$
+constituents before the reassembling of Parliament.$
+$
+He might ruminate in vain to find one attractive feature of his$
+programme. Parliament wearied him, and the ordinary practices of the law$
+no longer gave him pleasure.$
+$
+There was an interest in the work he was doing for the Government, and$
+if he had the faintest hint of pleasure in his immediate prospects, the$
+cause was to be found in the vexed problems centring about this new, and$
+loosely drawn, shipping law. It was a measure which had been passed in a$
+hurry, and when the acid test of litigation had been applied, some of$
+its weak points had been discovered.$
+$
+The weakest of these points was one affecting the load-line. In an$
+action heard before a High Court Judge, the doubtful clause had been$
+interpreted so as to render the Act a dead letter; and there were$
+particular and especial Governmental reasons why the appeal which the$
+Government had made from the verdict of the lower Court should upset$
+that decision.$
+$
+There is no need to give the particulars of the great dispute, which$
+arose over the three words ‚M-^@M-^\or otherwise loaded,‚M-^@M-^] and it is only$
+necessary to say that, before he had reached London, Mr. Maxell had$
+discovered a way for the Government out of their difficulty.$
+$
+It was this opinion which he delivered to a relieved Attorney-General,$
+and, with the new argument, the Government were able to present so$
+strong a case to the Court of Appeal, that a month after his return the$
+verdict of the lower Court was reversed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney-General, ‚M-^@M-^\the devils can take it to the House$
+of Lords now and still lose‚M-^@M-^Tthanks to your brain wave, Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They were smoking in the Crown Room at the Law Courts after the decision$
+had been delivered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where have you been for your holiday, by the way?‚M-^@M-^] asked the Attorney$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco?‚M-^@M-^] The Attorney nodded thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you hear anything of$
+friend Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We were staying at the same hotel,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A weird person,‚M-^@M-^] said the thoughtful Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\A very curious$
+man‚M-^@M-^Twhat a Chancellor that fellow would make!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He never struck me that way,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Maxell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know him well‚M-^@M-^TI mean, are you a particular friend of his?‚M-^@M-^]$
+demanded the Attorney.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\I know him‚M-^@M-^Tso many men in the law$
+know him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not by any chance associating with him in business now, are$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell promptly.$
+$
+It was a lie and he knew it was a lie. It was told deliberately from the$
+desire to stand well in the eyes of his friends. He knew Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reputation well enough, and just how he was regarded by the party whom$
+he had served for three years. Cartwright had been Member for a London$
+borough, but had resigned. ‚M-^@M-^\Pressure of business‚M-^@M-^] was the excuse he$
+gave, but there were people who said that it was owing to the pressure$
+of the Party Whips, who smelt a somewhat unsavoury case coming into$
+Court with Cartwright figuring prominently.$
+$
+There is no way of proving or disproving the statement, because the case$
+in which Cartwright most decidedly was interested was withdrawn from the$
+list at the last moment. The uncharitable say that it cost Cartwright a$
+small fortune to bring about this withdrawal, and certainly one of the$
+ladies interested (she was a small-part actress at the Hippoceus) gave$
+up her stage work and had been living in affluence ever since.$
+Cartwright pooh-poohed the suggestion that the case held anything$
+sensational‚M-^@M-^Tbut he did not enter political life again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am glad you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with him,‚M-^@M-^] said the Attorney simply.$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys an awfully nice fellow and I suppose he is as straight and as$
+sound as the best man in the City. But he‚M-^@M-^Ys a shifty fellow‚M-^@M-^Tjust a$
+little bit‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\a little wrong. You understand, Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tor$
+shall we say slightly shop-soiled?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is certainly a brilliant man,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, not desirous of$
+defending his friend too vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I suppose he is,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\All men like that are$
+brilliant. What a pity his genius does not run in a smooth channel, but$
+must follow the course of a burning cracker, here, there and everywhere,$
+exploding at every turn!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped down from the table, on the edge of which he had been sitting$
+and pulled off his robe.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad to know you‚M-^@M-^Yre not associated with Cartwright, anyway,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said.$
+$
+Maxell did not attempt to probe beneath the surface of his$
+twice-repeated remark.$
+$
+He went back to Cavendish Square to his flat and to a tiny, solemn-eyed$
+little girl who had been brought up from Hindhead that day on her$
+monthly visit to ‚M-^@M-^\Uncle Max.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright had not accompanied his friend to England, and with good$
+reasons. A great deal of his work was carried out in Paris, where he had$
+an important financial backing. He occupied a flat overlooking the$
+imposing, but none too convenient, Avenue of the Grand Army. His home$
+was at the unfashionable end of this interminable thoroughfare, which$
+meant that his rooms were larger and his rent cheaper, and that he was$
+freer from observation than he would have been had he lived according to$
+his means or station in a luxurious flat nearer the Etoil.$
+$
+He had a board meeting to attend, an informal board meeting, it is true,$
+but none the less important.$
+$
+Cartwright was the chairman and managing director of the London and$
+Paris Gold Syndicate, a flourishing concern which held big blocks of$
+shares in various land and gold-mining companies, and controlled three$
+mines of its own on the West Rand. Though a Company drawing a modest$
+revenue from its Johannesburg property, its operations were not confined$
+to gold development pure and simple. It was, in fact, an outside$
+broker‚M-^@M-^Ys on a grand scale. It gambled heavily and gambled wisely. The$
+shareholders seldom received less than a twelve and a half per cent.$
+dividend, and there were years when in addition it paid a bonus equal to$
+its own share capital.$
+$
+It numbered its clients at one hundred and fifty thousand, the majority$
+being small people who preferred speculation to investment‚M-^@M-^Tcountry$
+parsons, doctors and the small gamblers who lived fearfully on the$
+fringe of high finance. The shares were at a premium and Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+interest brought him a considerable sum annually. What probably$
+attracted the little speculator was the knowledge of the Company‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+reserve, which stood in the balance-sheet at a respectable figure. It$
+was the question of these reserves that occupied the attention of the$
+four quiet men who met informally in the room of a Paris hotel.$
+$
+There were three to one against Cartwright, because none of his$
+companions could see eye to eye with him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is too dangerous, M. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Gribber, whose nationality$
+was suspect; ‚M-^@M-^\our risks are already high and we cannot afford, in my$
+judgment, to extend them. The money would be subscribed over and over$
+again if you went to the English public.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt we make the profit?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\we could borrow from our$
+reserve.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That we can‚M-^@M-^Yt touch!‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the cautious Gribber, shaking his$
+head violently. ‚M-^@M-^\My faith, no, we cannot touch that! For it is certain$
+that the lean years will come when our clients will require their$
+dividends.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not pursue the subject. There were other ways of$
+financing his Moorish scheme.$
+$
+The Benson Syndicate, for example.$
+$
+He spoke eloquently of this new venture, which was to have its$
+headquarters in Paris, and would be under the eye of his sceptical$
+co-directors. He mentioned names glibly and easily‚M-^@M-^Tnames that carried$
+weight in the financial world. The three men agreed that the Benson$
+Syndicate had the appearance of a safe investment.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+More important was the business which brought Alfred Cartwright to the$
+St. Lazaire Station to meet a passenger a week later.$
+$
+She sprang from the train and looked round with doubting face, which$
+lighted the moment she saw the saturnine Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My! I am relieved,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I was scared to think you wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be$
+here to meet me, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd only got a few pounds left.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You got my wire?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, and she smiled, showing two rows of pearly$
+teeth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym still mystified,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What is it you want me to do in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us eat first and talk afterwards,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You must be hungry.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym starving!‚M-^@M-^] she laughed.$
+$
+He had a car waiting for her, and whisked her off to a little street$
+leading from the Boulevard des Italiens, where one of the best$
+restaurants in Paris is situated. The girl looked about her with an$
+approving air. The gaiety and luxury of the place appealed to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My word!‚M-^@M-^] she said enviously; ‚M-^@M-^\do you come to lunch here every day?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know this place?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve seen it,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but a three-franc dinner at Duval‚M-^@M-^Ys has$
+been my limit so far.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She told him how she had come to the Continent as a dancer, and had$
+‚M-^@M-^\starred‚M-^@M-^] in a tiny little cabaret in Montmartre as one of the ‚M-^@M-^\dashing$
+Sisters Jones,‚M-^@M-^] before she had been seen by the impresario who was$
+recruiting material for his tour through the Levant.$
+$
+Cartwright judged her to be nineteen, knew her to be extremely pretty,$
+and guessed that, under certain conditions, she would be presentable$
+even to the best of the circles in which he moved. He wondered, with a$
+grim smile, what Maxell, that austere and fastidious man, would say if$
+he knew that the girl was with him in Paris. Would Maxell accept her? He$
+thought not. Maxell was a thought straitlaced and in some ways was a$
+bore. But Maxell was necessary. He was a brilliant lawyer, and moreover$
+stood well with the Government, and there might come a time when Maxell$
+would be immensely useful. He could well afford to give the lawyer a$
+slice of the pickings he intended making, because Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys wants were$
+few and his ambitions on the modest side.$
+$
+Cartwright thought in millions. Maxell was a five-figure man. If all$
+went well with Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys scheme, undoubtedly he could well afford the$
+five figures.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What happened to your friend?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl, as though divining his$
+thoughts: ‚M-^@M-^\The man you told me I was to keep away from. Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+want him to see me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does it really matter?‚M-^@M-^] he asked; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys in England, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is he?‚M-^@M-^] She was curious.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, a friend of mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And who are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, facing him squarely. ‚M-^@M-^\If I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see$
+anything of you in Paris, that Smith, Brown or Robinson business isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+quite good enough. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me, but I want to know who I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+working for, and what is the kind of work you want me to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright pinched his neck‚M-^@M-^Ta nervous little trick of his when he was$
+thinking.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business interests here,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt want me for an office?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously. ‚M-^@M-^\My education$
+is perfectly rotten.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you for an office,‚M-^@M-^] he replied with a smile. ‚M-^@M-^\And yet$
+in a sense I want you to do office work. I have a little syndicate here,$
+which is known as the Benson Syndicate. Benson is my name‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Or the name you go by,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How sharp you are! Well, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt suppose O‚M-^@M-^YGrady is your name, if it$
+comes to that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She made no reply and he went on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want somebody in Paris I can rely upon; somebody who will receive$
+money, transmit it to the Benson Syndicate, and re-invest that money in$
+such concerns as I shall indicate.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt use long words,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\How do you know I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to rob$
+you? Nobody‚M-^@M-^Ys ever trusted me with money before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He might have told her that she would not be trusted with a great deal$
+at a time and that she would be carefully watched. He preferred,$
+however, an explanation more flattering to his new assistant. And not$
+only was it flattering, but it contained a big grain of truth,$
+expressing, to an extent, Alfred Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys creed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Women are more honest than men,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I should think twice before$
+I put a man‚M-^@M-^Teven my best friend‚M-^@M-^Tin the position I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting you. It$
+will be a simple matter, and I shall pay you well. You can live at one$
+of the best hotels‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, it is absolutely necessary that you should.$
+You may‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The hesitated‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\you may be Madam Benson, a rich Englishwoman.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him from under perplexed brows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the good of asking me to do that?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a tone of$
+disappointment. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were going to give me a job I could do.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Ym a fool at business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can remain a fool,‚M-^@M-^] he said coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing to do except$
+carry out a certain routine, which I shall explain to you so that you$
+can‚M-^@M-^Yt possibly make a mistake. Here is a job which gives you plenty of$
+time, pays you well, gives you good clothes and an auto. Now, are you$
+going to be a sensible girl and take it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She thought a moment, then nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it means lunching here every day, I‚M-^@M-^Yll take it,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+Thus was formed the remarkable Benson Syndicate, about which so much has$
+been written, and so many theories evolved. For, if the truth be told,$
+the Benson Syndicate had no existence until Cartwright called it into$
+being in Ciro‚M-^@M-^Ys Restaurant. It was born of the opposition he had$
+received, and its creation was hastened by certain disquieting telegrams$
+which arrived almost every hour from London.$
+$
+Cartwright was, as has been said, a man of many interests. The$
+door-plate of his office in Victoria Street, London, was covered with$
+the names of the companies which had their headquarters in the ornate$
+suite which he occupied. There were two other suites of offices in the$
+City of London for which Mr. Cartwright paid the rent, although he did$
+not pay it in his own name. There were syndicates and companies$
+innumerable, Development Syndicates, Exploitation Companies, Financial$
+and Mining Companies, all duly registered and all keeping one solicitor$
+busy; for the Companies Acts are tricky, and Cartwright was too clever a$
+man to contravene minor regulations.$
+$
+And to all these companies there were shareholders; some of them$
+contented, some‚M-^@M-^Tthe majority‚M-^@M-^Twholly dissatisfied with their lot, and$
+quite a large number who were wont to show their share certificates to$
+their friends as curiosities, and tell them the sad story of how they$
+were inveigled into investment.$
+$
+Only a clever company lawyer can describe in detail the tortuous$
+character of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys system of finance. It involved loans from one$
+company to another, very often on the security of shares in a third$
+company; it involved a system of over-drafts, drawn in favour of some$
+weakly member of his family, secured by the assets of one which could$
+show a bold face to the world, and was even quoted in the Stock Exchange$
+list; and divers other complicated transactions, which only the expert$
+mathematician could follow.$
+$
+Cartwright was a rich man, accounted a millionaire by his friends; but$
+he was that type of millionaire who was never at a loss for a thousand,$
+but who was generally hard up for ten thousand. He came to London much$
+against his will, in response to an urgent telegram, and, having cleared$
+the difficulties which his subordinates had found insuperable, he had a$
+few hours to attend to his private affairs before he took the train back$
+to Paris.$
+$
+His secretary produced a heap of small bills requiring settlement, and$
+going through these, he paused before one printed slip, and frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That boy‚M-^@M-^Ys school fees weren‚M-^@M-^Yt paid last term,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said the secretary. ‚M-^@M-^\If you remember, I mentioned the matter$
+to you when you were in London last. I was taking upon myself the$
+responsibility of paying the fees, if you hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt returned. The boy is$
+coming up to-day, by the way, sir, to be measured for some clothes.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Coming here?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Cartwright, interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright picked up the bill.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he read. ‚M-^@M-^\What does T. A. C. stand for‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XTake A$
+Chance‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understood he was named after you‚M-^@M-^TTimothy Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the secretary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes; of course,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright grinned. ‚M-^@M-^\Still, Take A Chance isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a bad$
+name for a kid. When is he arriving?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He ought to be here now,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, looking at his watch. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+out and see.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He disappeared into the outer office, and presently returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The boy is here, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Would you like to see him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bring him in,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to meet this nephew, or$
+cousin, or whatever he is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He wondered vaguely what had induced him to take upon himself the$
+responsibility of the small child, and with remorseless judgment$
+analysed the reason as being personal vanity.$
+$
+The door opened and a child strode in. ‚M-^@M-^\Strode‚M-^@M-^] is the only word to$
+describe the quick, decisive movement of the bright-eyed lad who looked$
+with unflinching eye at Cartwright. Cartwright did not look at his$
+clothes, but at the grey, clear eyes, the firm mouth, extraordinarily$
+firm for a boy of fourteen, and the capable and not over-clean hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, son,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\So you‚M-^@M-^Yre my nephew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cousin, I think,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, critically examining the contents of$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys table. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre Cousin Alfred, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I‚M-^@M-^Ym a cousin, am I? Yes, I suppose I am,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amused.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy, ‚M-^@M-^\is that the school bill? The Head has been$
+rather baity about that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\‚M-^@M-^XBaity‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys a new one on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shirty,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy calmly. ‚M-^@M-^\Annoyed, I suppose, is the correct$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to be?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A financier,‚M-^@M-^] said T. A. C. Anderson promptly.$
+$
+He seated himself, leant his elbow on the desk and his head on his hand,$
+his eyes never leaving Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that‚M-^@M-^Ys a great scheme‚M-^@M-^Tfinance,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym a whale at$
+mathematics.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What particular branch of finance?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Other people‚M-^@M-^Ys finance,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy promptly; ‚M-^@M-^\the same business as$
+yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright threw back his head and laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And do you think you‚M-^@M-^Yd be able to keep twenty companies in the air at$
+the same time?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the air?‚M-^@M-^] the boy frowned. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, you mean going all at once? Rather!$
+Anyway, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The phrase struck Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take a chance? That‚M-^@M-^Ys curious. I called you Take A Chance Anderson just$
+before you came in.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, they all call me that,‚M-^@M-^] said the boy indifferently. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,$
+they‚M-^@M-^Yre bound to stick a label on to a fellow with an initial like mine.$
+Some of them call me ‚M-^@M-^XTin and Copper Anderson,‚M-^@M-^Y but most of them‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a rum kid,‚M-^@M-^] said his cousin. ‚M-^@M-^\You can come to lunch with me.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER IV$
+$
+$
+MR. ALFRED CARTWRIGHT had the enviable faculty of placing outside of$
+his mind all subjects and persons which were unpleasant to think upon.$
+Possessing this power, he could as lightly dismiss the memory of$
+responsibilities, pleasant or unpleasant. He had scarcely left London$
+before he had waived Master T. A. C. Anderson into oblivion. To do him$
+justice, he had certainly speculated vaguely upon assuring his cousin‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+future; but his mind was so completely occupied with his own that there$
+was really not room for both‚M-^@M-^Tand Take A Chance Anderson had to go.$
+$
+He reached Paris by the evening train, and drove straight to the$
+apartment he had taken for his new prot√©g√©. He found her installed in a$
+very comfortable flat on the unfashionable side of the Seine, and was$
+welcomed with relief.$
+$
+Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had not entirely overcome her suspicions of the _bona$
+fides_ of her newfound acquaintance. Yet, since he had not made love to$
+her, but, on the contrary, had made it very clear that the part he$
+expected her to play in his schemes involved no loss of self-respect,$
+she was becoming reconciled to a relationship which, to say the least,$
+was a strange one. She had established herself in a third-floor office$
+on one of the boulevards, an uncomfortable and unaccustomed figure in an$
+environment which was wholly foreign to her experience, though there was$
+no need for her embarrassment, since she constituted the whole of the$
+staff, and the callers were confined to the postman and the concierge$
+who acted as office-cleaner.$
+$
+She was to learn, however, that a daily attendance at her ‚M-^@M-^\bureau‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute the whole of her duties, or fulfil all Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+requirements.$
+$
+It was not until after dinner that night that Cartwright revealed$
+himself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sadie, my young friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, between puffs of his cigar, ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+going to tell you just what I want you to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought I knew,‚M-^@M-^] she said, on her guard, and he laughed softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll never quite know what I want you to do,‚M-^@M-^] he said frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\until$
+I tell you. Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym putting it to you very straight. I want nothing$
+from you except service. And the service I require is of a kind which$
+you need not hesitate to give me. You‚M-^@M-^Yre an actress, and I can speak to$
+you more plainly than I could to some unsophisticated girl.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She wondered what was coming, but had not long to wait.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will tell you something,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\which is really more important$
+than my name, about which you showed so much curiosity. There is a man$
+in this city whom I want to get at.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is a man who has it in his power to ruin me‚M-^@M-^Ta drunken sot of a$
+fellow, without brain or imagination.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He went on to explain briefly that he himself was a company promoter,$
+and that he had an interest in a mine, as yet unproved, in Morocco.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is why you were there?‚M-^@M-^] she nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is exactly why,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Unfortunately, right in the$
+midst of the ground which I have either bought or secured mineral rights$
+over, is a block of land which is the property of this man. He is a$
+Spaniard‚M-^@M-^Tdo you speak Spanish?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is precious little!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt matter,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright shook his head. ‚M-^@M-^\He speaks English very$
+well. Now, this land is absolutely valueless to the man, but every$
+attempt I have made to buy it has been unsuccessful, and it is vitally$
+necessary at this moment, when I am floating a company to develop the$
+property, that his claims should be included in my properties.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is his name?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] repeated Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\I seem to have heard$
+that name before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is pretty common in France, but not so common in Spain,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr.$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And what am I to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will get you an introduction to him,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright; ‚M-^@M-^\he‚M-^@M-^Ys a man$
+with a fine eye for beauty, and in the hands of a clever girl could be$
+wound round her little finger.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see what you mean,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but nothing doing!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I have told you that it is necessary for me to$
+acquire this property. I am taking you into my confidence, and I know$
+that you will respect that confidence. I am willing to pay any$
+reasonable sum, and I neither want you to steal it nor make any personal$
+sacrifice to serve my ends. I am willing to pay, and pay heavily.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you call heavily?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl coolly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For the property twenty thousand‚M-^@M-^Tfor you ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^]$
+suggested Cartwright, and the girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys got me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Tell me what your plan is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My plan is this,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\You will appear to Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^TI$
+will arrange that‚M-^@M-^Tas a wealthy young American lady who has been$
+spending the winter in Morocco. His property follows a little wooded$
+hill, one of the prettiest formations of its kind in the Angera country.$
+You must rave about that hill, never cease speaking of its beauty and$
+its attractiveness; and you must tell him that you would give anything$
+in the world if you could build a house amidst that beautiful$
+scenery‚M-^@M-^Tdo you understand me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is a man somewhat susceptible to feminine charms,‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright$
+went on, ‚M-^@M-^\and, unless I am greatly mistaken, he will in one of his$
+obliging moods, offer you the land at a nominal figure, particularly as$
+he has been bitterly disappointed in his attempt to find gold.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl after consideration. ‚M-^@M-^\You promised me$
+that if I came to Paris you would get me a job in one of the theatres.$
+That is what I am after, and the only thing I am fit for. The other$
+business doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt seem decent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds!‚M-^@M-^] murmured Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a lot,‚M-^@M-^] agreed the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but how am I coming out of this$
+business? I come out hopelessly compromised.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear girl‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait a moment,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly; ‚M-^@M-^\let‚M-^@M-^Ys have a clear understanding.$
+You don‚M-^@M-^Yt expect me to walk up to Se√±or Brigot the first time I meet$
+him, or even the second, and say: ‚M-^@M-^XYou‚M-^@M-^Yve a very nice property. What$
+will you sell it for?‚M-^@M-^Y That is not the kind of transaction you expect me$
+to conduct, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means just a little more than you say,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\it means$
+dinners and suppers and hand-holdings and stringing him along. And after$
+it is all over, where am I? I‚M-^@M-^Yve got as much respect for my character as$
+you have for yours, Mr. Mysterious. I want to come out well in this$
+business as you do, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to leave my name behind, or be$
+known in Paris‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the world‚M-^@M-^Tas a decoy duck. I‚M-^@M-^Yd do an awful lot$
+to please you, because I like you and because you‚M-^@M-^Yve been decent to me.$
+But ‚M-^@M-^Xan awful lot‚M-^@M-^Y does not mean making me so cheap that I am left in$
+the slightly-soiled basket. Do you understand what I mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amazed at the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys cool reasoning. He$
+had not given her credit for any of these fine sentiments she now$
+enunciated, and he was piqued, and at the same time a little pleased.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When you said you‚M-^@M-^Yd give me ten thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+sounded good. But it is not good enough. I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea in the back of my$
+mind that the matter is a much bigger one for you than you‚M-^@M-^Yve told me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How big do you imagine?‚M-^@M-^] bantered Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think it is big enough to ruin you,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl calmly, ‚M-^@M-^\and that$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yd be willing to pay any price to get this property. Otherwise, you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+go to the man or send your lawyer in the ordinary way. Now, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want$
+your ten thousand pounds, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to make a proposition to you.$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve said I like you and that‚M-^@M-^Ys no more than the truth. You told me you$
+were a bachelor and I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you that I‚M-^@M-^Ym man-free and heart-free. I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt say I love you, and I don‚M-^@M-^Yt flatter myself that you love me. But$
+if you want this thing to go through, and if you want me to go down in$
+the mud to get it, you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to pay the price‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And the price is‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] asked Cartwright curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to marry me,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright could only gasp his admiration; and then he$
+began to laugh, at first quietly, and then, as the humour of the$
+situation gained upon him, so loudly that the other patrons of the Caf√©$
+Scribe turned to look at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a rum idea,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, keeping her eyes on his.$
+$
+He nodded to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Ys a bargain!‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She looked at him as she put out her hand and took his, and slowly shook$
+her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My!‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You want that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys land pretty badly, _I_ know!‚M-^@M-^]$
+and Cartwright began to laugh again.$

+$
+Se√±or Brigot lived in some style for a man who was on the verge of ruin.$
+He had a small house at Maisons Lafitte and a flat on the Boulevard$
+Webber. He was a heavy, tired-looking man, with a dark moustache,$
+obviously dyed, and a short beard, bearing evidence of the same$
+attention. M. Brigot, like Mr. Cartwright, had many interests; but his$
+chief interests were his own tastes and predilections. It was Se√±or$
+Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys boast that, although he had lived for twenty years in Paris, he$
+had never seen Paris between the hours of six in the morning and one in$
+the afternoon. His breakfast hour was two o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. By six o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the$
+evening he was becoming interested in life; and at the hour when most$
+people retire to rest, he was in the prime of his day.$
+$
+It happened on a certain evening that M. Brigot, who usually met dinner$
+in an amicable frame of mind, sat down at his favourite table at the$
+Abbaye with a big frown, and answered the polite _ma√Ætre d‚M-^@M-^Yh√¥tel‚M-^@M-^Ys_$
+cheery ‚M-^@M-^\Good evening‚M-^@M-^] with a snarl.$
+$
+Amongst his many enterprises and few possessions, and this Mr.$
+Cartwright did not know, was the proprietorship and management of a$
+small, ramshackle wooden theatre in the town of Tangier. He was likewise$
+interested in several cabarets throughout Spain. But what pained him$
+most at the moment was not distressing reports from any of these, but a$
+six-page letter received that afternoon from his son, in which the hope$
+of the house of Brigot had explained his reasons for discharging$
+immediately a very necessary servant. Therefore Se√±or Brigot swore under$
+his breath and cursed his first-born.$
+$
+Coincident with the arrival of the letter had come one Jose Ferreira,$
+who had been detained for a week at Madrid. Se√±or Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys mind was$
+occupied with Jose Ferreira when that worthy, smirking apologetically,$
+as though conscious of the shabbiness of his dress-clothes, sidled into$
+a seat on the opposite side of the table. Se√±or Brigot glared at him a$
+moment, and Jose Ferreira shifted uneasily in his chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had telegraphed to me, I would have settled the matter,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Brigot, as though carrying on a conversation which he had broken off a$
+few minutes before. ‚M-^@M-^\Instead, like the fool you are, you come all the$
+way to Paris, wasting your time in Madrid, and the first I hear of the$
+matter is from my son.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was deplorable,‚M-^@M-^] murmured Jose, ‚M-^@M-^\but Don Brigot‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot!‚M-^@M-^] sneered the father of that worthy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don Brigot is a$
+monkey! Why did you take notice of him? Have you nothing else to do in$
+Tangier but to look after that flea-ridden theatre? Have you no other$
+duties?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The young se√±or was emphatic,‚M-^@M-^] murmured the apologetic Jose. ‚M-^@M-^\He$
+demanded that I should leave and what could I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot grunted something uncomplimentary. Whether it was intended for$
+his son or for Ferreira, it was difficult to say. Ferreira was content$
+to take it to himself.$
+$
+Half-way through the dinner Brigot became more human.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will always be quarrels about women, my good Jose, and it is your$
+business to be diplomatic,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\My son is a fool; but then, all$
+young men are fools. Why should you neglect my interests because Emanuel$
+is a bigger fool than ever? Only this week I intended travelling to$
+Tangier with the representative of a very rich syndicate who wishes to$
+buy my land.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same se√±or as before?‚M-^@M-^] asked the interested Jose, who was not only$
+the manager of Tangier‚M-^@M-^Ys theatre, but was also the representative of the$
+rusty little gold-mining company which Brigot had floated.$
+$
+The other nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The same cursed Englishman,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Quite unconscious of the fact that his master was cursing the very man$
+whom Jose had most recently cursed, the little man smiled$
+sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I also have a hatred of the English,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\With what insolence do$
+they treat one!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+For some time M. Brigot sat in silence, but presently he wiped his mouth$
+on his napkin, tossed down a tumbler of red wine, and crooked his finger$
+at his companion, inviting closer attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a day, or perhaps two, I shall send you back to Tangier,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre?‚M-^@M-^] began Jose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The theatre‚M-^@M-^Tbah!‚M-^@M-^] exclaimed the other scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\A donkey-driver$
+could look after the theatre! It is the mine!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The mine?‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other in some astonishment.$
+$
+So long had it been since a spade had been put to the ground, so long$
+had those hopes of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys been apparently dead, that the very word$
+‚M-^@M-^\mine‚M-^@M-^] had ceased to be employed when referring to the property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My Englishman will buy it,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot confidently. ‚M-^@M-^\I happen to know$
+that he has taken up property in the neighbourhood, and he has already$
+made me an offer. But such an offer! He shall pay my price, Jose,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, nodding as he picked his teeth, ‚M-^@M-^\and it will be a big price,$
+because it is desirable that I should have money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose did not ask the price, but his employer saved him the trouble.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Five million pesetas,‚M-^@M-^] he said confidently; ‚M-^@M-^\for such a price the$
+property will be sold, always providing, my friend, that we do not$
+discover gold before the sale.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Jose smiled weakly, a circumstance which seemed to annoy his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a fool,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot irritably; ‚M-^@M-^\you have no brains! You think$
+that is a preposterous sum? Wait!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When his subordinate‚M-^@M-^Ys dinner was finished, Jose was dismissed$
+peremptorily. Brigot had a round of calls to make, a succession of$
+people to be visited; and whilst he might interview the little man at$
+dinner without losing caste, he had no desire to take him round to his$
+usual haunts.$
+$
+It was at the Abbaye at that golden hour when the price of wine soars$
+and all that is smartest in Paris is assembled in the big saloon, that$
+M. Brigot, who had reached a stage of geniality, met an entrancing$
+vision. Brigot saw the girl and her cavalier at one of the tables, and$
+recognised in the latter a well-known man about town. The latter caught$
+his eye and walked across to him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is your charming companion?‚M-^@M-^] whispered Brigot, whose failing was,$
+as Cartwright accurately surmised, a weakness for pretty faces.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is an American lady who has just come from Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+glibly.$
+$
+Cartwright had chosen Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys companion very well. In a few$
+minutes Brigot had crossed to the other table and taken a seat, was$
+introduced, and was in that pleasant glow of mind which comes to the man$
+of his class who is conscious of having made an impression.$
+$
+This ‚M-^@M-^\American widow,‚M-^@M-^] with her queer, broken French, her beautiful$
+eyes, and the charming distinction which goes best with good clothes,$
+was more lovely than any woman he had ever met‚M-^@M-^Tso he swore to himself,$
+as he had sworn before. The friendship progressed from day to day, and$
+so great was the impression which the girl had made, that Brigot was$
+seen abroad at most unusual hours.$
+$
+The patient Jose Ferreira was despatched on a mission to Madrid, partly$
+because Brigot was tired of seeing him hanging about, and partly because$
+there was some genuine business to be done in the capital.$
+$
+Sadie reported progress to her employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, yes, he‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy enough about me,‚M-^@M-^] she said complacently, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going a little crazy myself. How long is this to go on?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Another week?‚M-^@M-^] suggested Cartwright, smiling approvingly at the gloom$
+on the pretty face. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you mentioned the fact that you‚M-^@M-^Yve taken a$
+fancy to his land?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wanted to give it to me there and then,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\but you know$
+what these Spaniards are. If I had accepted, there would have been$
+nothing for me but the front door.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right,‚M-^@M-^] agreed Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\He is the kind of fish you must play.$
+Did he say anything about other offers he had received for the$
+property?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He spoke about you,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\he called you Benson‚M-^@M-^Tis that your real$
+name?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is good enough,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is queer,‚M-^@M-^] mused the girl, looking at him thoughtfully, ‚M-^@M-^\that I$
+never meet any of your friends in Paris, and that nobody knows you‚M-^@M-^Tby$
+name. I went down to your flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+confessed frankly, ‚M-^@M-^\and asked the concierge. You‚M-^@M-^Yre Benson there too.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In my business,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary that one should be discreet.$
+The name which goes in London is not good enough for Paris. And _vice$
+versa_,‚M-^@M-^] he added.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a strange man. I suppose if you marry me in the name of Benson$
+it will be legal?‚M-^@M-^] she asked dubiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it will be legal. I‚M-^@M-^Ym surprised at a girl of your$
+intelligence asking such a question,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\What is the$
+programme for to-night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled a little face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Marigny and supper at Corbets‚M-^@M-^Tsupper in a private dining-room.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it‚M-^@M-^Ys come to that, has it? Well, you ought to make good to-night,$
+Sadie. Remember, I am willing to pay up to fifty thousand pounds. It is$
+going to be a tough job raising that money, and it will break my heart$
+to pay it. But it will not only break my heart, but it will break me$
+everlastingly and confoundedly to pay the man‚M-^@M-^Ys own price‚M-^@M-^Tand his$
+property must be bought.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll do my best,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have no doubt in your mind$
+that it is going to be hard.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+At one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock the next morning he sat reading in his room, when a knock$
+came to his door and the girl came in. She was half hysterical, but the$
+light of triumph was in her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Got it!‚M-^@M-^] he repeated in wonder. ‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean he sold?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For ten thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthree hundred thousand francs. What do you$
+think of your little Sadie?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you serious?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She nodded, smiling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T?‚M-^@M-^] he began.$
+$
+She hesitated and closed her eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt talk about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have to see him to-morrow at$
+his lawyers, and the property will be transferred to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And after?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She smiled grimly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The after-part will not be as pleasant as M. Brigot imagines,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I tell you, that fellow‚M-^@M-^Ys crazy‚M-^@M-^Tstark, staring mad. But I felt$
+an awful beast, and I think he‚M-^@M-^Yll kill me when he discovers I‚M-^@M-^Yve sold$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that worry you,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright easily.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER V$
+$
+$
+HE saw the girl down to her waiting auto, and went back to his rooms$
+to think. It was curious that at that hour, when the big trouble on his$
+mind seemed likely to roll away, that his thoughts flew instantly to$
+Maxell. What would the prim Maxell say, if he knew? He was satisfied$
+that Maxell would not only disapprove, but would instantly and without$
+notice sever all connection with the adventurous company promoter.$
+Maxell would be outraged, appalled. Cartwright smiled at the thought.$
+$
+He was under no illusion as to his own conduct. He knew he was acting$
+despicably; but this view he dismissed from his mind as being too$
+unpleasant for contemplation. Maxell was a prig‚M-^@M-^Ta necessary prig, but$
+none the less priggish. He was necessary, at any rate, to Cartwright.$
+Anyway, Maxell stood to win if the scheme went through.$
+$
+Cartwright had reached nearly the end of his financial tether, and his$
+whole future was bound up in the success or failure of the new$
+promotion. He had exhausted every bit of his credit in order to take up$
+the Angera property which he knew was rich in gold, and offered$
+possibilities which no project of his had offered before.$
+$
+He had milked his other companies dry, he had played with reserves; all$
+except his Anglo-Parisian Finance Company, where the directors were too$
+strong to allow him his own way; and, although Maxell was not aware of$
+the fact, his ‚M-^@M-^\partner‚M-^@M-^] had spent fabulous sums, not only in acquiring$
+the land itself but in purchasing other gold-mining property in the$
+region. It was a gamble, and a dangerous gamble. He was risking the$
+substance of his fortune for the shadow of unlimited wealth.$
+$
+Yet, was it a risk? he asked himself; with the properties that he could$
+include in his new North Morocco Gold Mining Association‚M-^@M-^Tthat was to be$
+the title of the new company‚M-^@M-^Tthere could be no doubt as to the result$
+of the public issue. The British public dearly love a gamble, and a$
+gold-mining gamble, with all its mysteries and uncertainties, more$
+dearly than any.$
+$
+He went to bed late, but was taking his chocolate and roll before a$
+little caf√© on the boulevard before nine. At half-past nine he was$
+joined by the girl.$
+$
+Cartwright had been undecided as to whether he should take his _petit$
+d√©jeuner_ outside or inside the caf√©, and had decided, since the morning$
+was bright and warm, to breakfast under the striped awning in full view$
+of the street. Such great events hang upon slight issues.$
+$
+Scarcely had the girl seated herself opposite to him, when a pedestrian,$
+passing on the other side of the boulevard, halted and stared. Mr.$
+Ferreira had sharp eyes and a wit not altogether dulled by his$
+monotonous occupation.$
+$
+Cartwright produced a bulky package from his pocket and laid it on the$
+table before the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Put that in your bag and be careful with it,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\there are three$
+hundred thousand francs in notes. When the property is transferred to$
+you, you must bring the transfer along to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about your promise?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I will keep,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt forget that you have the best$
+guarantee in the possession of the transfer. Legally, it is your$
+property until it is made over to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She sat looking at the package absently, and presently she said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve got to get me out of Paris at once. Otherwise I am due to leave$
+by the Sud Express‚M-^@M-^Twith Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is a train for Havre at two-fifteen,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He saw her into her car‚M-^@M-^Tanother indiscretion since it brought him out$
+of the shadow which the awning afforded, and gave the observer on the$
+other side of the road an unmistakable view.$
+$
+Brigot was waiting for her‚M-^@M-^Ta heavy-eyed, weary-looking man, whose hand$
+shook whenever it rose to stroke his short, pointed beard.$
+$
+His lawyer watched him curiously as he stepped forward to meet the girl$
+with hands outstretched. It was not the first time that he had seen his$
+client overwhelmed by a pretty face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everything is ready, Nanette,‚M-^@M-^] said the eager M. Brigot. (‚M-^@M-^\Nanette‚M-^@M-^] was$
+the newfound name which Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady employed for this adventure.) ‚M-^@M-^\See$
+here, I have all the documents ready!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I have the money,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the girl as she put the package down on$
+the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The money!‚M-^@M-^] Se√±or Brigot waved such sordid matters out of existence$
+with a magnificent flourish. ‚M-^@M-^\What is money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Count it,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will do no such thing,‚M-^@M-^] said the other extravagantly. ‚M-^@M-^\As a$
+caballero, it hurts me to discuss money in connection‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+But his lawyer had no sentiment, and had slipped the string from the$
+package and was now busily counting the thousand-franc notes. When he$
+had finished, he put them on the desk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you one moment, M. Brigot?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Brigot, holding the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and devouring her with his eyes, turned$
+impatiently.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The document, my friend, the document! Give me a$
+pen!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There is one point in the deed I must discuss,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer firmly,$
+‚M-^@M-^\if mademoiselle will excuse us for a moment‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He opened the door of$
+his inner office invitingly and with a shrug M. Brigot followed him in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have told you, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\that I do not think your$
+action is wise. You are surrendering a property for a sum less than a$
+quarter of what you paid for it to a perfectly unknown woman‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\M. l‚M-^@M-^YAvocat,‚M-^@M-^] said the other gravely, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a lady who$
+to me is more precious than life!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer concealed a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have often spoken to you about ladies who have been more precious to$
+you than life,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly, ‚M-^@M-^\but in their cases, no transfer of$
+valuable property was involved. What do you know of this lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know nothing except that she is adorable,‚M-^@M-^] said the reckless$
+Spaniard. ‚M-^@M-^\But for the fact that, alas! my wife most obstinately refuses$
+to die or divorce me, I should be honoured to make madame my wife. As it$
+is, what a pleasure to give her the land on which to build a beautiful$
+villa overlooking my gorgeous Tangier‚M-^@M-^TI am moving to Tangier very soon$
+to look after my other property‚M-^@M-^Tand to know that her blessed$
+presence‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer spread out despairing hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then there is nothing to be done,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I only tell you that you$
+are transferring a valuable property to a lady who is comparatively$
+unknown to you, and it seems to me a very indiscreet and reckless thing$
+to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They returned again to the outer apartment, where the girl had been$
+standing nervously twisting the moir√© bag in her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is the document, madame,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer to her relief. ‚M-^@M-^\Se√±or$
+Brigot will sign here‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The indicated a line‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\and you will sign there. I$
+will cause these signatures to be witnessed, and a copy of the document$
+will be forwarded for registration.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl sat down at the table, and her hand shook as she took up the$
+pen. It was at that moment that Jose Ferreira dashed into the room.$
+$
+He stood open-mouthed at sight of the girl at the table. He tried to$
+speak, but the sound died in his throat. Then he strode forward, under$
+the glaring eye of his employer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This woman‚M-^@M-^Tthis woman!‚M-^@M-^] he gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ferreira,‚M-^@M-^] cried Brigot in a terrible voice, ‚M-^@M-^\you are speaking of a$
+lady who is my friend!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Tshe‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthe man pointed to her with shaking finger‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\she is the$
+woman! She escaped! . . . The woman I told you of, who ran away with an$
+Englishman from Tangier!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot stared from one to the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre mad,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She is the woman,‚M-^@M-^] squeaked Ferreira, ‚M-^@M-^\and the man also is in Paris. I$
+saw them together this morning at the Caf√© Furnos! The man who was in$
+Tangier, of whom I told the se√±or, and this woman, Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brigot looked at the girl. She had been caught off her guard, and never$
+once had the keen eyes of the lawyer left her. Given some warning, she$
+might have dissembled and carried the matter through with a high hand.$
+But the suddenness of the accusation, the amazingly unexpected vision of$
+Jose, had thrown her off her guard, and Brigot did not need to look$
+twice at her to know that the charges of his subordinate were justified.$
+She was not a born conspirator, nor was she used to intrigues of this$
+character.$
+$
+Brigot gripped her by the arm and pulled her from the chair. He was half$
+mad with rage and humiliation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the name of this man?‚M-^@M-^] he hissed. ‚M-^@M-^\The name of the man who took$
+you from Tangier and brought you here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was white as death and terribly afraid.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson,‚M-^@M-^] she stammered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The lawyer and Brigot uttered the words together, and the Spaniard,$
+releasing his hold stepped back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So it was Benson!‚M-^@M-^] he said softly. ‚M-^@M-^\Our wonderful Englishman who wanted$
+to swindle me out of my property, eh? And I suppose he sent you, my$
+beautiful American widow, to purchase land for your villa! Now, you can$
+go back to Mr. Benson and tell him that, if my property is good enough$
+for him to buy, it is good enough for me to keep. You‚M-^@M-^Tyou!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He made a dart at her with upraised hand, but the lawyer was before him$
+and gently pushed him back.$
+$
+He jerked his head to the girl and, shaking like a leaf, she stepped to$
+the door and went stumbling down the stairs, which she had mounted with$
+such confidence a few minutes before.$
+$
+Cartwright received the news with extraordinary equanimity.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has saved us the bother of going out of Paris,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\And it was my own fault. I never connected that infernal$
+fellow Ferreira with Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys enterprises. And anyway, we should not$
+have met in public. He said he saw us at the caf√©, did he?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did my best,‚M-^@M-^] she faltered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you did your best,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, patting her hand. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+tough luck, but it can‚M-^@M-^Yt be helped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was a long silence, then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What about me?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Where do I come in? I suppose you have$
+no further use for my services?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course I have,‚M-^@M-^] he said genially. Then, after a longer pause, ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know that you‚M-^@M-^Yre the only person in this world that I have ever$
+taken so completely into my confidence and shown what, for a better$
+expression, I will call the seamy side of my business? I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to tell$
+you a lot more, because it would be a relief to me to get it off my$
+chest. But I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling you this, that if I marry you to-day, you‚M-^@M-^Yll have$
+to play your part to save me from everlasting ruin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ruin?‚M-^@M-^] she said, startled, and he laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not the kind of ruin that means you‚M-^@M-^Yll go short of food,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but$
+the sort of ruin that may mean‚M-^@M-^Twell, ruin from my point of view. Now$
+you must understand this thing clearly, Sadie. I‚M-^@M-^Ym out for a big stake,$
+and if I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pull it off, it‚M-^@M-^Ys as likely as not that I‚M-^@M-^Yll go out.$
+You‚M-^@M-^Yre a clever, useful sort of kid, and I have an idea that you may be$
+even more useful. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys to be no sentiment in this marriage, mind!$
+You have just to sit here and hold tight and do as you‚M-^@M-^Yre told, and you$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got to pry into my business any further than I want you to. And$
+if I go away and don‚M-^@M-^Yt come back, you must reckon me as dead. I‚M-^@M-^Yve a lot$
+of business in America and elsewhere, which often takes me away for$
+months at a time, and you‚M-^@M-^Yre not to get uneasy. But if you don‚M-^@M-^Yt hear$
+from me‚M-^@M-^Twhy, you can go down to the Lafayette and buy yourself the$
+grandest little suit of mourning that you can afford!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I be able to afford it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall put some Rentes to your credit at the Lyonnais. That will give$
+you a steady income in case anything happens.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was troubled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite like this idea,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What will happen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Cartwright flicked away the ash from the end of his cigar and said$
+cheerfully:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That depends entirely upon the view which is taken of a certain$
+prospectus issued in London this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER VI$
+$
+$
+THE New Angera Syndicate was registered as a private company, and its$
+prospectus was not made public. Officially, the shares were not offered$
+to general subscription, and actually they had been subscribed‚M-^@M-^Tor the$
+first issue of five hundred thousand had‚M-^@M-^Tby a little group of shrewd$
+speculators in the City of London, who, before now, had made vast sums$
+from Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys promotions. The five hundred thousand shares brought$
+in about half that number of pounds, and nobody doubted that the$
+properties consolidated for the purposes of flotation included the block$
+of claims described in the prospectus as ‚M-^@M-^\lately the property of Se√±or$
+Brigot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Gold had been found on the Angera reef, and gold in sufficient quantity$
+to make the new company a very promising speculation. That Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+property could be made to pay, had it been properly managed, was common$
+knowledge in the City of London. A dozen offers had been made for this$
+concession, but none had been quite acceptable to Se√±or Brigot, whose$
+estimate of the value of the mine varied with the passing hour.$
+$
+Probably, had it been possible to secure an interview with M. Brigot at$
+one o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the afternoon, when he arose with a splitting head and a$
+dry throat, his possessions might have been acquired at the price of a$
+quart of sweet champagne.$
+$
+But, as the day progressed and his views of life became more charitable,$
+his estimate expanded until, by seven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the evening, which hour$
+he as a rule reserved for any business discussion, his figure was$
+awe-inspiring. Nobody in the City doubted for one moment that Cartwright$
+had purchased the property. Though his system of finance might not$
+commend itself to the barons and even the baronets of Capel Court, there$
+was no question of his honesty.$
+$
+Was it by some extraordinary fluke that Maxell, who had hitherto shared$
+in the profits of promotion, had kept aloof from this last and greatest$
+of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys flutters? No application for shares was ever found. He$
+heard (he said at a subsequent inquiry) in a round-about way of the$
+flotation, and saw a copy of the prospectus, and was a little worried.$
+He knew that when he had left Cartwright in Paris, not only was the$
+Brigot mine outside of his friend‚M-^@M-^Ys control, but there was precious$
+little prospect of bringing the Spaniard to a reasonable frame of mind.$
+$
+Cartwright must have done his work quickly, he thought, and have paid$
+heavily; and this latter reflection worried him even more because he had$
+a fairly accurate idea as to the condition of Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys private$
+finances. His private thoughts on this occasion are set forth in the$
+report of the Attorney-General‚M-^@M-^Ys Committee of Investigation.$
+$
+He was eating his solitary dinner in Cavendish Square when the telephone$
+bell rang and the voice of Sir Gregory Fane, the Attorney-General,$
+saluted him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should like to see you, Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you come round to$
+Clarges Street after dinner?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Certainly,‚M-^@M-^] replied Maxell promptly, and hung up the receiver,$
+wondering what new difficulties had arisen, which called for a$
+consultation; for he was not on visiting terms with Mr. Attorney.$
+$
+In the tiny drawing-room of the house occupied by the Cabinet Minister,$
+Maxell was surprised to find another visitor waiting‚M-^@M-^Tno less a person$
+than Fenshaw, the Prime Minister‚M-^@M-^Ys private secretary.$
+$
+The Attorney-General came straight to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\we want your seat in the House of Commons.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The deuce you do!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, raising his eyebrows.$
+$
+The Attorney nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We also want to give you some reward for the excellent services you$
+have rendered to the Government,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But mostly‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This eyes$
+twinkled‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\it is necessary to find a seat for Sir Milton Boyd‚M-^@M-^Tthe$
+Minister of Education has been defeated at a by-election, as you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other nodded. The communication was a surprise to him and he$
+wondered exactly what position was to be offered him which would involve$
+his resignation from the House. For one brief, panicky moment he had$
+connected Cartwright and his delinquencies with this request for an$
+interview, but the Attorney‚M-^@M-^Ys speech had dispelled that momentary fear.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quilland, as you know, has been raised to the Court of Appeal,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+the Attorney, speaking of a well-known Chancery Judge, ‚M-^@M-^\and we are$
+departing from our usual practice by bringing over a man from the King‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+Bench to take his place. Now, Maxell, how does a judgeship appeal to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The K.C. could only stare.$
+$
+Of the many things he did not expect, it was elevation to the Bench,$
+although he was a sound, good lawyer, and the Bench is the ambition of$
+every silk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good!‚M-^@M-^] said the brisk Attorney. ‚M-^@M-^\Then we will regard it as settled. The$
+appointment will not be announced for two or three days, so you‚M-^@M-^Yve a$
+chance of clearing up your more urgent work and preparing a letter for$
+your constituents. You might say a kind word for the new candidate who$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt particularly popular in your part of the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+One of Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys first acts was to write a letter to Cartwright. All$
+Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys correspondence went to his London office, and was forwarded$
+under separate cover to Paris. It was a long letter, recapitulating$
+their friendly relationship, and ending:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This promotion, of course, means that we can no longer be$
+    associated in business, and I have instructed my broker to sell$
+    all the shares I possess in your and other companies forthwith.$
+    As you know, I have very definite views about the high prestige$
+    of the Bench; and whilst, in any circumstances, I feel that I$
+    can go to that dignified position with clean hands, my mind will$
+    be freer if I cut all the cords which hold me to commerce of$
+    every shape and description.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Three days later the letter came to Cartwright, and he read it through$
+with a thoughtful expression on his face. He read it twice before he$
+slowly folded it and put it into his inside pocket.$
+$
+Maxell was to be made a Judge!$
+$
+He had never considered that contingency, and did not know whether to be$
+pleased or sorry. He was losing the service of a man who had been a$
+directing force in his life, greater than Maxell himself ever imagined.$
+It was not so much the advice which he asked and received from the$
+King‚M-^@M-^Ys Counsel, but rather Cartwright had secured help by the simple$
+process of making a study of the other‚M-^@M-^Ys moods and expressions.$
+$
+He knew the half-frown which greeted some schemes, put forward$
+tentatively over the dinner table, and it was that little sign of$
+displeasure which could squash the scheme rather than any considered$
+advice which Maxell might have given. He was losing a good advocate, a$
+very sound legal adviser. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, it did not$
+matter very much. Fate had put a period to an old phase of life, and$
+many things had come to an end coincidently. He was taking his afternoon$
+tea when the letter had arrived, and the new Mrs. Cartwright marked with$
+interest the depression which followed the arrival of the mail.$
+$
+The new period was beginning excitingly, he thought. He had found a new$
+method of doing business, bolder and more desperate than any he had$
+attempted before; and with this development he had lost a man upon whom$
+he placed a great deal of reliance. Incidentally, he had just been$
+married, but this fact did not bulk very largely in his reckoning.$
+Maxell might serve him yet. The memory of an old business$
+partnership‚M-^@M-^Tfor in such an aspect did Cartwright interpret their$
+previous relationship‚M-^@M-^Tthe memory, too, of favours done, of financial$
+dangers shared, might serve him well if things went wrong. Maxell had a$
+pull with the Government‚M-^@M-^Ta greater pull, since he was now a Judge of$
+the Supreme Court.$
+$
+Maxell a Judge! It seemed queer. Cartwright had all the properly$
+constituted Englishman‚M-^@M-^Ys reverence for the Bench. In spite of much$
+experience in litigation, and an acquaintance with lawyers of all kinds$
+and stations, he reserved his awe for the god-like creature who sat in$
+wig and gown, and dispensed justice evenhandedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you had a worrying letter?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no,‚M-^@M-^] he said, a little impatiently; ‚M-^@M-^\it is nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She had hoped for a glimpse of the envelope, but was disappointed.$
+Curiously enough, she ascribed the fact that her husband passed under a$
+strange name and would not divulge his own, to a cause which was far$
+from the truth, and was a great injustice to a man who, if he had not$
+given her his proper name, had given her a title to whatever name he$
+had. That thought she revealed for the first time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know what I think?‚M-^@M-^] she said unexpectedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know you thought very much,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\In what particular$
+department of speculation does your mind wander?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] she answered. She was a little afraid of sarcasm,$
+as are all children and immature grown-ups. ‚M-^@M-^\It was about your name I$
+was thinking.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He frowned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why the dickens don‚M-^@M-^Yt you leave my name alone?‚M-^@M-^] he snapped. ‚M-^@M-^\I have$
+told you that it is all for your good that I‚M-^@M-^Ym called Benson and known$
+as Benson in this town. When we go to London you will discover my name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know why you keep it dark.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why do I keep it dark?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, fixing his eyes on her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre married already.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at her for a moment, and then burst into such a peal of$
+laughter that the girl knew her shot was wide of the mark.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a weird person,‚M-^@M-^] he said, getting up. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going out to see an$
+old friend of ours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of ours?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brigot is the gentleman‚M-^@M-^Ys name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He won‚M-^@M-^Yt see you,‚M-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, won‚M-^@M-^Yt he?‚M-^@M-^] said the grim man. ‚M-^@M-^\I rather think he will.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot would not willingly have received one whose name was anathema,$
+but Cartwright got over the difficulty of his reception by the simple$
+process of sending up a card inscribed with the name of Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys lawyer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You!‚M-^@M-^] spluttered M. Brigot, rising to his feet as the other entered the$
+room and closed the door behind him. ‚M-^@M-^\This is an outrage! It is$
+monstrous! You will leave this house immediately, or I will send for the$
+police!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, just keep quiet for a moment, Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, seating$
+himself coolly. ‚M-^@M-^\I have come to see you as one business man to another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I refuse to discuss any business with you,‚M-^@M-^] stormed his unwilling host.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are a scoundrel, a conspirator‚M-^@M-^Tbah! why do I talk to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because you‚M-^@M-^Yre broke!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright in calm, level tones, and he$
+used the Spanish word for ‚M-^@M-^\broke,‚M-^@M-^] which is so much more expressive than$
+any word in English.$
+$
+The conversation was carried on in this language, for Cartwright had an$
+intimate knowledge of its idioms and even of its patois.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your creditors in Paris are gathering round like hawks about a dead$
+cow. Your attempt to sell your Moorish property has been a failure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You know a great deal,‚M-^@M-^] sneered Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Possibly you also know that I$
+am going to work the mine myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard that said of you for years,‚M-^@M-^] said he, ‚M-^@M-^\but the truth is,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre wholly incapable of working anything. You‚M-^@M-^Yre one of nature‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+little spenders‚M-^@M-^Tnow, Brigot, don‚M-^@M-^Yt let us quarrel. There is a time to$
+end feuds like ours, and this is that time. I am a business man, and so$
+are you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre as anxious to sell your property at a good price as I am$
+to buy it. I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to make you an offer.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot laughed sarcastically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded with gentle irony. ‚M-^@M-^\To build a house$
+for a beautiful American widow, eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright accepted the gibe with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to show you my hand,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will be infamously dirty,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot, who was in his bright six$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock mood.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know there is gold in the Angera,‚M-^@M-^] the other went on, without$
+troubling to notice the interruption, ‚M-^@M-^\and I know that, properly worked,$
+your mine may pay big profits.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I will sell out,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot after consideration, ‚M-^@M-^\but at a price.$
+I have told you before I will sell out‚M-^@M-^Tat a price.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But what a price!‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright, raising his eyebrows and with a$
+gesture of extravagant despair. ‚M-^@M-^\It is all the money in the world!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nevertheless, it is the price,‚M-^@M-^] said M. Brigot comfortably.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you what I am willing to do.‚M-^@M-^] Cartwright stroked his chin as$
+though the solution had just occurred to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I will float your$
+property in London, tacking on a number of other properties which I have$
+bought in the neighbourhood. I am willing to pay you two hundred$
+thousand pounds‚M-^@M-^Tthat is to say, six million francs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+M. Brigot was interested. He was so interested that, for the moment, he$
+could forget his animosity and private grievances. It was true that, as$
+Cartwright had said, his creditors were becoming noisy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In cash, of course?‚M-^@M-^] he said suddenly.$
+$
+Cartwright shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can have a portion in cash and the rest in shares.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] Brigot snapped his fingers. ‚M-^@M-^\I also can issue shares, my friend.$
+What are shares? Pieces of paper which are not worth their ink. No, no,$
+you deceive me. I thought you had come to me with a genuine offer. There$
+is no business to be done between you and me, Mr. Cartwright. Good$
+evening.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright did not move.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A portion in cash‚M-^@M-^Tsay, fifteen thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he suggested; ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+is a lot of money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To you‚M-^@M-^Tyes, but not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said the magnificent Brigot. ‚M-^@M-^\Give me$
+two-thirds in cash and I will take the rest in shares. That is my last$
+word.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This offer is open until‚M-^@M-^Twhen?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Until to-morrow at this hour,‚M-^@M-^] replied Brigot.$
+$
+As Cartwright was going, a man tapped at the door. It was Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+‚M-^@M-^\secretary,‚M-^@M-^] who was also his valet. He handed a telegram to the$
+Spaniard, and Brigot opened and read. He was a long time digesting its$
+contents, and Cartwright waited for a favourable opportunity to say$
+good-bye. All the time his mind was working, and he thought he saw$
+daylight. Two-thirds of the money could be raised, and he could breathe$
+again.$
+$
+Presently Brigot folded up the telegram and put it in his pocket, and$
+there was on his face a beatific smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good night, Se√±or Brigot,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\I will see you to-morrow$
+with the money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It will have to be big money, my friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Brigot, and there was a$
+note of exultation in his voice. ‚M-^@M-^\To buy my little property will cost$
+you half a million English pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know Solomon Brothers, the financiers of London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know them very well,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright steadily. He had good reason$
+to know Solomon Brothers, who had taken a large block of shares in his$
+new syndicate.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just had a telegram from Solomon Brothers,‚M-^@M-^] said Se√±or Brigot,$
+speaking slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and they ask me to give them the date when my property$
+was transferred to your syndicate. They tell me it is included in your$
+properties which you have floated. You know best, Mr. Cartwright,$
+whether my little mine is worth half a million English pounds to$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tespecially if I put a date agreeable to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Blackmail, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright between his teeth, and without a word$
+left the room.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VII$
+$
+$
+HE went straight back to his flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army, and$
+the girl could see by his face that something had happened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might pack my bag, will you?‚M-^@M-^] he said almost brusquely. ‚M-^@M-^\I have a$
+letter or two to write. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to London. Important business has$
+arisen, and I may be gone some time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Wisely she asked no questions, but carried out his instructions. When$
+she came back from the room with a little gripsack packed, he was$
+blotting the envelope of the last letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Post these after I have gone,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I come down to the station and see you off?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The less you and I are seen together, the better, I think,‚M-^@M-^] he said$
+with a faint smile.$
+$
+He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a cash-box. From this he$
+extracted a thick wad of notes, and, counting them rapidly, he tossed a$
+respectable bundle into her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may want this,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you have a regular income, but$
+you must keep in touch with the Lyonnais. For the moment I should advise$
+you to go to‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^The looked at the ceiling for inspiration‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to Nice or$
+Monte Carlo. Keep away from the tables,‚M-^@M-^] he added humorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But‚M-^@M-^Tbut,‚M-^@M-^] said the bewildered girl, ‚M-^@M-^\for how long will you be gone?$
+Can‚M-^@M-^Yt I come with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is impossible,‚M-^@M-^] he said sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\You must go to the South of$
+France, leave by to-night‚M-^@M-^Ys train. Give your address to nobody, and take$
+another name if necessary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are things very wrong?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pretty bad,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\But don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry. I may be gone for a year, even$
+more. There are plenty of things you can do, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt go back into the$
+profession yet awhile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of taking up cinema work,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You might do worse than go to America‚M-^@M-^Tif I am a long time gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stuffed the remainder of the notes into his pocket, picked up his$
+bag, and with no other farewell than a curt nod, left her.$
+$
+She was only to see him once again in her life-time.$
+$
+He crossed the Channel by the night boat and came to London in the early$
+hours of the morning. He drove straight away to his hotel, had a bath$
+and shaved. His plan was fairly well formed. Everything depended upon$
+the charity which Messrs. Solomon Brothers might display towards his$
+strange lapse.$
+$
+At breakfast he read in _The Times_ that ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Justice Maxell took his$
+seat upon the Bench‚M-^@M-^] on the previous day, and that paragraph, for some$
+reason, seemed to cheer him.$
+$
+At ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock he was in the City. At half-past ten he was interviewing$
+the senior partner of Solomon Brothers, a man with an expressionless$
+face, who listened courteously to the somewhat lame excuses which$
+Cartwright offered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was a mistake of a blundering clerk,‚M-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. ‚M-^@M-^\As$
+soon as I discovered the error, I came back to London to withdraw all$
+the money which had been subscribed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a pity you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt come back yesterday, Mr. Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Solomon.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I mean,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\that we have already placed this matter in$
+the hands of our solicitors. I suggest that you had better interview$
+them.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright made a further pilgrimage to the solicitors of Solomon$
+Brothers, and found them most unwilling to see him. That was an ominous$
+sign, and he went back to his office in Victoria Street conscious that a$
+crisis was at hand. At any rate, the girl was out of the way; but, what$
+was more important, she, one of the principal witnesses in so far as$
+Brigot and his property were concerned, was not available for those who$
+might bring a charge against him. She was his wife, and her lips were$
+sealed, and this consequence of his marriage was one which he had not$
+wholly overlooked when he had contracted his strange alliance.$
+$
+What a fool he had been! The property might have been transferred and in$
+his hands, if he had not antagonised a wretched little Spanish$
+theatrical manager. But, he reflected, if he had not antagonised that$
+manager, he would not have possessed the instrument for extracting the$
+transfer from the amorous Brigot.$
+$
+At the top of a heap of letters awaiting him was one written in a firm$
+boyish hand, and Cartwright made a little grimace, as though for the$
+first time recognising his responsibility.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson; my lad, you will have to take a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and pushed the letter aside unopened.$
+$
+He lunched at his club, sent a brief letter to Maxell, and returned to$
+his office at two in the afternoon. His clerk told him that a man was$
+waiting for him in the inner office. Cartwright hesitated with his hand$
+on the door; then, setting his teeth, he stepped in.$
+$
+The stranger rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you Mr. Alfred Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is my name,‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am Inspector Guilbury, of the City Police,‚M-^@M-^] said the stranger, ‚M-^@M-^\and I$
+shall take you into custody on charges under the Companies Act, and a$
+further charge of conspiracy to defraud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go ahead,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+All the week preceding the trial, Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys heart was filled with$
+warm, gratitude to his erstwhile friend. He did not doubt, when his$
+solicitor told him that Mr. Justice Maxell would try his case, that$
+Maxell had gone a long way out of his way to get himself appointed the$
+Old Bailey judge. How like Maxell it was‚M-^@M-^Tthat queer, solemn stick‚M-^@M-^Tand$
+how loyal!$
+$
+Cartwright had a feeling for Maxell which he had never had before. At$
+first he had feared the embarrassment which might be Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys at having$
+to try a case in which an old friend was implicated, and had even hoped$
+that the new judge would have nothing to do with the trial. He did not$
+despair of Maxell pulling strings on his behalf, and he realised that$
+much could be done by judicious lobbying.$
+$
+The charge against him was a grave one. He had not realised how serious$
+it was until he had seen that respectful array of counsel in the Lord$
+Mayor‚M-^@M-^Ys Court, and had heard his misdemeanours reduced to cold legal$
+phraseology. But he did not wholly despair. Brigot had been coming to$
+London to give evidence, and on his journey there had occurred an$
+incident which suggested to the accused man that Providence was fighting$
+on his side. The Spaniard had had a stroke in the train to Calais, and$
+the doctors reported that he might not recover. Not that Brigot‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+evidence was indispensable. There was, apparently, a letter and two$
+telegrams in existence, in the course of which Brigot denied that he had$
+ever parted with his property; and the onus lay upon Cartwright to prove$
+that he had acted in a _bona fide_ manner‚M-^@M-^Tthat was impossible of proof,$
+and nobody knew this better than Cartwright.$
+$
+And ever his mind reverted to the singular act of generosity on the part$
+of his old friend. He did not doubt for one moment that Maxell had$
+‚M-^@M-^\worked‚M-^@M-^] the case so that it fell to him to try it.$
+$
+It was a bright morning in May when he came up the steps of the Old$
+Bailey and took his place in the dock. Almost immediately after, the$
+Judge and the Sheriff entered from the door behind the plain oaken$
+bench. How well the judicial robes became Maxell, thought Cartwright. He$
+bowed slightly and received as slight a bow in reply. Maxell was looking$
+pale. His face was drawn, and there was resolution in his speech and in$
+his eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before this case proceeds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I wish to direct attention to a$
+statement in one of the newspapers this morning, that I was associated$
+with the accused in business, and that I am in some way involved,$
+directly or indirectly, in the company promotion‚M-^@M-^Teither as a$
+shareholder or an indirect promoter‚M-^@M-^Twhich is the subject of the present$
+charge. I wish to utter an emphatic denial to that statement.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He spoke clearly and slowly and looked the prisoner straight in the eye,$
+and Cartwright nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can only endorse your lordship‚M-^@M-^Ys statement,‚M-^@M-^] he said emphatically.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Your lordship has never had any dealings with me or any business$
+transactions whatsoever.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a minor sensation which provided a headline for the evening$
+newspapers. The case proceeded. It was not particularly involved and the$
+witnesses were few but vital. There were those business men who had$
+subscribed or promised to subscribe to the syndicate. There was Mr.$
+Solomon, who could give an account of his dealings with the prisoner.$
+But, most damning of all, was a sworn statement made by Brigot before an$
+English solicitor, a Commissioner of Oaths. And it was such a statement$
+which only documentary proof, produced by the accused man, could refute.$
+$
+Cartwright listened to the evidence untroubled of mind. He knew that his$
+counsel‚M-^@M-^Ys speech, delivered with such force, was little less than an$
+admission of guilt and a plea for mercy. The last word would be with the$
+judge. A verdict of ‚M-^@M-^\guilty‚M-^@M-^] there must necessarily be. But he thought$
+that, when later his counsel pleaded for a minimum sentence, he saw a$
+responsive look in the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
+$
+The stigma of imprisonment did not greatly distress Cartwright. He had$
+lived on the narrow border-line of illegalities too long; he had weighed$
+chances and penalties too nicely to bother about such ephemeral things$
+as ‚M-^@M-^\honour.‚M-^@M-^] His system of finance was reviewed, and certain minor$
+charges arising out of the manipulation of funds were gone into. It was$
+late in the evening when the Judge began his summing up.$
+$
+It was a fair, if a conventional address he delivered to the jury.$
+Obviously, thought Cartwright, he could do nothing less than call$
+attention to the serious nature of the charge, the interests involved,$
+the betrayal of shareholders, and the like. On the whole, the summing up$
+did not diminish the comforting sense that the worst that lay before him$
+was a few months‚M-^@M-^Y imprisonment and then a start in another land under$
+another name. He never doubted his ability to make money. The summing up$
+was ended, and the jury retired. They were gone twenty minutes, and when$
+they came back it was a foregone conclusion what their verdict would be.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Guilty,‚M-^@M-^] was the reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And is that the verdict of you all?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Justice Maxell was examining his notes, and presently he closed the$
+little book which he was consulting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The charge against Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is one of the most$
+serious which could be brought against a business man. The jury have$
+returned a verdict of guilty, and I must say that I concur in that$
+verdict. I am here in my place‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^This voice shook a little‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\to$
+administer and maintain the laws of England. I must do all that in me is$
+possible to preserve the purity of commercial life and the condition of$
+English commercial honesty.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright waited for that ‚M-^@M-^\but‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tit did not come.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In view of the seriousness of the frauds and irregularities which the$
+accused has committed, with a cynical disregard for the happiness or$
+fortune of those people whose interests should have been his own, I$
+cannot do less than pass a sentence which will serve as an example to$
+all wrongdoers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright gasped and gripped the edge of the dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You, Alfred Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, and again looked him straight in$
+the eye, ‚M-^@M-^\will be kept in penal servitude for twenty years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright swallowed something. Then he leaned across the edge of the$
+dock.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You swine!‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily, and then the warders dragged him away.$
+$
+Two days later there was a new sensation. The newspapers announced that$
+Mr. Justice Maxell had been compelled, on account of ill-health, to$
+resign from the Bench, and that His Majesty had been pleased to confer a$
+baronetcy of the United Kingdom upon the ex-Judge.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER VIII$
+$
+$
+SOME nine years after the events detailed in the last chapter, a$
+fairly clever young actress who had drifted into the cinematograph$
+business, faced one of the many disappointments which had made up her$
+life. In many ways the disappointment was more bitter than any she had$
+previously experienced, because she had banked so heavily upon success.$
+$
+If there was any satisfaction to be had out of the new tragedy it was to$
+be found in the fact that the fault was not entirely hers. An impartial$
+critic might, indeed, absolve her from all responsibility.$
+$
+In this particular instance she regarded herself in the light of a$
+martyr to indifferent literature‚M-^@M-^Tnot without reason.$
+$
+When the Westminster Art Film Company was tottering on its last legs,$
+Mr. Willie Ellsberger, chairman and chief victim, decided on one big$
+throw for fortune. The play decided upon does not matter, because it was$
+written by Willie himself, with the assistance of his advertising man,$
+but it contained all the stunts that had ever got by in all the photo$
+plays that had ever been produced, and in and out of every breathless$
+situation flashed Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, the most amazing, the most charming,$
+the most romantic, the highest salaried artiste that filmland had ever$
+known.$
+$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady had come to London from Honolulu, after she had inherited$
+her father‚M-^@M-^Ys considerable fortune. She came, a curious visitor, to the$
+studios, merely as a spectator, and had laughingly refused Mr.$
+Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys first offer, that gentleman having been attracted by her$
+perfect face and the grace of her movements; but at last, after$
+extraordinary persuasion, she had agreed to star in that stupendous$
+production, ‚M-^@M-^\The Soul of Babylon,‚M-^@M-^] for a fee of ¬£25,000, which was to be$
+distributed amongst certain Honolulu charities in which she was$
+interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] she told a newspaper man, ‚M-^@M-^\this is to be my first and my last$
+film. I enjoy the work very much, but naturally it takes up a great deal$
+of my time.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you returning to Honolulu?‚M-^@M-^] asked our representative.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No,‚M-^@M-^] replied Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, ‚M-^@M-^\I am going on to Paris. My agent has bought$
+me the Duc de Montpelier‚M-^@M-^Ys house in the Avenue d‚M-^@M-^YEtoile.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A week after the picture was finished, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady waited on the$
+chairman by appointment.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] said that gentleman, leaning back in his chair, and$
+smiling unhappily, ‚M-^@M-^\it‚M-^@M-^Ys a flivver!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We ran it off for the big renter from the North, and he says it is$
+about as bad as it can be, and that all the good in it is so obviously$
+stolen, that he dare not risk the injunction which would follow the$
+first exhibition. Did Simmonds pay you your last week‚M-^@M-^Ys salary?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, Mr. Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Ellsberger shrugged.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sets me back another twenty pounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said and reached for his$
+cheque-book. ‚M-^@M-^\It is tough on you, Sadie, but it‚M-^@M-^Ys tougher on us. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+so sure that it is so tough on you, though. I spent a fortune$
+advertising you. There isn‚M-^@M-^Yt anybody in this country who hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt heard of$
+Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady, and,‚M-^@M-^] he added grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yve more publicity than I hope$
+I shall get when this business goes into the hands of the Official$
+Receiver.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So there‚M-^@M-^Ys no more work?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl after a pause.$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys hands said: ‚M-^@M-^\What can I do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You ought not to have any difficulty in getting a shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\with$
+your figure.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Especially when the figure‚M-^@M-^Ys twenty pounds a week,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+unsmilingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I was a fool ever to leave Paris. I was doing well there$
+and I wish I‚M-^@M-^Yd never heard of the cinema business.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Still young and pretty and slim, with a straight nose and a straighter$
+mouth, she had no appeal for Mr. Ellsberger, who in matters of business$
+had an unsympathetic nature.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you go back to Paris?‚M-^@M-^] he said, speaking very deliberately$
+and looking out of the window. ‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps that affair has blown over by$
+now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What affair?‚M-^@M-^] she asked sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve friends in Paris,‚M-^@M-^] said the chairman, ‚M-^@M-^\good, bright boys who go$
+around a lot, and they know most of what‚M-^@M-^Ys going on in town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, biting her lips thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Reggie van Rhyn‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys the trouble you heard about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what happened, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll never believe in a thousand years$
+that I stabbed him,‚M-^@M-^] she said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been too much of$
+a lady for that sort of thing‚M-^@M-^TI was educated at a convent.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger yawned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take that to Curtis, will you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\If he can get any free$
+publicity for you, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yll be glad. Now take my advice‚M-^@M-^Tstay on. I‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+put Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady way up amongst the well-known products of Movieland,$
+and you‚M-^@M-^Yll be a fool if you quit just when the public is getting$
+interested in you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym in bad, but that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt affect you, Sadie, and$
+there ain‚M-^@M-^Yt a producer in England who wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt jump at you and give you$
+twice the salary I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She stood up, undecided. Ellsberger was growing weary of the interview.$
+He made a great show of pulling out notepaper and rang the bell for his$
+stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The publicity‚M-^@M-^Ys fine,‚M-^@M-^] she admitted, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yve felt good about the$
+work. Why the letters that I‚M-^@M-^Yve had from people asking for my autograph$
+and pictures of my Honolulu estate‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe smiled a little$
+frostily‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\people in society, too. Why, a titled man who wrote to me$
+from Bournemouth, Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger was interested, indeed, he was fascinated. He waved away$
+his stenographer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down, Sadie,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre sure it was Maxell? Sir John$
+Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys class there.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And there‚M-^@M-^Ys money, too,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+get in touch with him, Sadie? A fellow like that would think nothing of$
+putting ten thousand into a picture if he was interested in a girl. If$
+you happen to be the girl, Sadie, there‚M-^@M-^Yll be a thousand pound contract$
+for you right away.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Her straight lips were a trifle hard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you want is an angel, and the Judge is the best kind of angel you$
+could wish for.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has he got money?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] said the hands of Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\What a ridiculous question to$
+ask!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Money!‚M-^@M-^] he scoffed. ‚M-^@M-^\Money to burn. Do you mean to say you‚M-^@M-^Yve never$
+heard of Sir John Maxell, never heard of the man who sent his best$
+friend to gaol for twenty years? Why, it was the biggest sensation of$
+the year!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sadie was not very interested in history, but momentarily, by virtue of$
+the very warm and well punctuated letter which reposed in her bag, she$
+was interested in Sir John.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is he married?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl naturally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He is not married,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger emphatically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Any children?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no children, but he has a niece‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got some legal$
+responsibility as regards her; I remember seeing it in the newspapers,$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys her guardian or something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Ellsberger looked at the girl with a speculative eye.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you his letter?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She nodded and produced the epistle.$
+$
+It was polite but warm. It had some reference to her ‚M-^@M-^\gracious talent,‚M-^@M-^]$
+to her ‚M-^@M-^\unexampled beauty‚M-^@M-^] which had ‚M-^@M-^\brought pleasure to one who was no$
+longer influenced by the commonplace,‚M-^@M-^] and it finished up by expressing$
+the hope that they two would meet in the early future, and that before$
+leaving for Paris she would honour him by being his guest for a few$
+days.$
+$
+Ellsberger handed the letter back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Write him,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and, Sadie, consider yourself engaged for another$
+week‚M-^@M-^Twrite to him in my time. He‚M-^@M-^Ys fallen for all that Press stuff, and$
+maybe, if he‚M-^@M-^Ys got that passionate admiration for your genius$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll‚M-^@M-^Tsay, you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to stay in the picture business and finish by$
+marrying that kind of trouble, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pointed through the wide windows to a youth who was coming across$
+from the studio to the office, swinging a cane vigorously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Observe the lavender socks and the wrist watch,‚M-^@M-^] he chuckled. ‚M-^@M-^\But$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt make any mistake about Timothy Anderson. He‚M-^@M-^Ys the toughest amateur$
+at his weight in this or any other state and a good boy, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+kind of fellow that women like you marry‚M-^@M-^Tget acquainted with the$
+Judge.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+With only a preliminary knock, which he did not wait to hear answered,$
+the young man had swung through the door, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do, Miss O‚M-^@M-^YGrady?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I saw your picture‚M-^@M-^Tfine! Good acting,$
+but a perfectly rotten play. I suppose you wrote it, Ellsberger?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wrote it,‚M-^@M-^] admitted that gentleman gloomily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It bears the impression of your genius, old bird.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson shook his head reproachfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It only wanted you as the leading man, and it would have been dead$
+before we put the titles in,‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger with a grin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of the movies for good,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy Anderson, sitting himself$
+on a table. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a demoralising occupation‚M-^@M-^Twhich reminds me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped from the table, thrust his hand into his pocket, and$
+producing a roll of notes:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I owe you twenty-five pounds, Ellsberger,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Thank you very$
+much. You saved me from ruin and starvation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He counted the money across, and Mr. Ellsberger was undoubtedly$
+surprised and made no attempt to conceal the fact. So surprised was he$
+that he could be jocose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Fixed a big contract with Mary Pickford?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\N-no,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I struck a roulette game‚M-^@M-^Tand took a chance.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Took a chance again, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said Ellsberger. ‚M-^@M-^\One of these days you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+take a chance and never get better of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Pooh!‚M-^@M-^] said the other in derision. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you think that‚M-^@M-^Ys any new$
+experience for me? Not on your life. I went into this game with just$
+twelve pounds and my hotel bill three weeks in arrears. I was down to my$
+last half-crown, but I played it and came out with three hundred$
+pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Whose game was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mr. Ellsberger curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tony Smail,‚M-^@M-^] and Mr. Ellsberger whistled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, that‚M-^@M-^Ys one of the toughest places in town,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a$
+wonder you came away with the money‚M-^@M-^Tand your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I took a chance,‚M-^@M-^] said the other carelessly, and swung his legs once$
+more over the edge of the desk. ‚M-^@M-^\There was some slight trouble when I$
+came out of Smail‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] he shrugged his shoulders, ‚M-^@M-^\just a little$
+horseplay.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had followed the conversation keenly. Any talk which circled$
+about finance had the effect of concentrating her attention.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you always take a chance?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Always,‚M-^@M-^] said the other promptly.$
+$
+This woman did not appeal to him. Timothy possessed a seventh sense$
+which he called his ‚M-^@M-^\Sorter,‚M-^@M-^] and Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady was already sorted$
+into the heap of folks who, had life been a veritable voyage, would have$
+been labelled ‚M-^@M-^\Not Wanted.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going by the next boat to New York,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\then I‚M-^@M-^Yll go to$
+California. Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll take in Kempton on my way, for a fellow I met at$
+the hotel has a horse running which can catch pigeons. Good-bye, Miss$
+O‚M-^@M-^YGrady. I wish you every kind of luck.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She watched him disappear, sensing his antagonism and responding$
+thereto. If he could judge women by intuition, she judged him by reason,$
+and she knew that here was a man whose mental attitude was one of$
+dormant hostility.$
+$
+It would be unfair to her to say that it was because she recognised the$
+clean mind and the healthy outlook and the high principles of this young$
+man that she disliked him. She was not wholly bad, because she had been$
+the victim of circumstances and had lately lived a two-thousand pound$
+life on a one-hundred pound capacity. She looked after him, biting her$
+lips as though she were solving a great problem.$
+$
+Presently she turned to Ellsberger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll write to Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+By a curious coincidence Timothy Anderson had the idea of approaching$
+Sir John Maxell also, though nearly a year passed before he carried his$
+idea into execution.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER IX$
+$
+$
+THE initials ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] before young Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys name stood for$
+Timothy Alfred Cartwright, his pious but practical parent having, by$
+this combination, made a bid for the protection of the saints and the$
+patronage of Cousin Al Cartwright, reputedly a millionaire and a$
+bachelor. It was hoped in this manner that his position on earth and in$
+heaven would be equally secure.$
+$
+What Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chances are in the hereafter the reader must decide; but$
+we do know that Cousin Al Cartwright proved both a weak reed and a$
+whited sepulchre. Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys parents had departed this life two years$
+after Alfred Cartwright had disappeared from public view, leaving behind$
+him two years‚M-^@M-^Y work for a committee of Investigating Accounts.$
+$
+When his surviving parent died, the boy was at school, and if he was not$
+a prodigy of learning he was at least brilliant in parts.$
+$
+Though it was with no great regret that he left school, he was old$
+enough and shrewd enough to realise that a bowing acquaintance with the$
+differential calculus, and the ability to conjugate the verb ‚M-^@M-^\avoir‚M-^@M-^] did$
+not constitute an equipment, sufficiently comprehensive (if you will$
+forgive these long words), to meet and defeat such enemies to human$
+progress as he was likely to meet in this cruel and unsympathetic world.$
+$
+He had a small income bequeathed by his mother in a will which was$
+almost apologetic because she left so little, and he settled himself$
+down as a boarder in the house of a schoolmaster, and took up those$
+branches of study which interested him, and set himself to forget other$
+branches of education which interested him not at all.$
+$
+Because of his ineradicable passion for challenging fate it was only$
+natural that ‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C.‚M-^@M-^] should bear a new significance, and since some$
+genius had christened him ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson the name stuck. And$
+he took chances. From every throw with fate he learnt something. He had$
+acquired some knowledge of boxing at school, and had learnt enough of$
+the art to enable him to head the school. Such was his faith in himself$
+and his persuasive eloquence that he induced Sam Murphy,$
+ex-middle-weight and proprietor of the Stag‚M-^@M-^Ys Head, Dorking, to nominate$
+and support him for a ten-rounds contest with that redoubtable$
+feather-weight, Bill Schenk.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson took his chance. He also took the count in the$
+first round, and, returning to consciousness, vowed a vow‚M-^@M-^Tnot that he$
+would never again enter the ring, but that he would learn something more$
+of the game before he did. Of course, it was very disgraceful that a man$
+of his antecedents should become a professional boxer‚M-^@M-^Tfor professional$
+he became in the very act of failure‚M-^@M-^Tbut that worried him not at all.$
+$
+It is a matter of history that Bill Schenk was knocked out by Kid$
+Muldoon, and that twelve months after his initiation into the prize ring$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. Anderson‚M-^@M-^] fought twenty rounds with the Kid and got the decision on$
+points. Thereafter, the ring knew ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson no more.$
+$
+He took a chance on race-courses, backing horses that opened at tens and$
+closed at twenties. He backed horses that had never won before on the$
+assumption that they must win some time. He had sufficient money left$
+after this adventure to buy a book of form. He devoted his undoubted$
+talent to the study of other games of chance. He played cards for$
+matches with a broker‚M-^@M-^Ys clerk, who harboured secret ambitions of going$
+to Monte Carlo with a system; he purchased on the hire system$
+wonderfully cheap properties on the Isle of Thanet‚M-^@M-^Tand he worked.$
+$
+For all his fooling and experimenting, for all his gambling and his$
+chancing, Timothy never let a job of work get past him, if he could do$
+it, and when he wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt working for sordid lucre he was working for the$
+good of his soul. He went to the races with a volume of Moli√®re‚M-^@M-^Ys plays$
+under his arm, and between events he read, hereby acquiring the respect$
+of the racing fraternity as an earnest student of form.$
+$
+So he came by violent, yet to him easy, stages to Movieland‚M-^@M-^Tthat Mecca$
+which attracts all that is enterprising and romantic and restless. He$
+took a chance in a juvenile lead, but his method and his style of$
+actions were original. Producers are for ever on the look out for$
+novelty, but they put the bar up against novel styles of acting and$
+expression. Ellsberger had tried him out because he had known his$
+father, but more because he had won money over him when he had beaten$
+Kid Muldoon; but even Ellsberger was compelled to suggest that Timothy$
+put in two long years ‚M-^@M-^\atmosphering‚M-^@M-^] before he essayed an individual$
+r√¥le on the screen.$
+$
+Timothy was not certain whether his train left at ten minutes to seven$
+or at ten minutes past seven, so he arrived in time for the ten minutes$
+to seven, which was characteristic of him, because he never took a$
+chance against the inflexible systems.$
+$
+He reached New York without misadventure, but on his way westward he$
+stayed over at Nevada. He intended spending a night, but met a man with$
+a scheme for running a mail-order business on entirely new lines,$
+invested his money, and by some miracle managed to make it last a year.$
+At the end of that time the police were after his partner, and Timothy$
+was travelling eastward by easy stages.$
+$
+He came back to New York with fifty-five dollars which he had won from a$
+Westerner on the last stage of the journey. The track ran for about$
+twenty miles along the side of the road, the wager between them was a$
+very simple one; it was whether they would pass more men than women on$
+the road. The Westerner chose men and Timothy chose women. For every man$
+they saw Timothy paid a dollar, for every woman he received a dollar. In$
+the agreed hour they passed fifty-five more women than they passed men$
+and Timothy was that many dollars richer. There were never so many women$
+abroad as there were that bright afternoon, and the Westerner couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+understand it until he realised that it was Sunday‚M-^@M-^Ta fact which Timothy$
+had grasped before he had made his wager.$
+$
+Two months later he was back in London. How he got back he never$
+explained. He stayed in London only long enough to fit himself up with a$
+new kit before he presented himself at a solid mansion in Branksome$
+Park, Bournemouth. Years and years before, Sir John Maxell had written$
+to him, asking him to call upon him for any help he might require, and$
+promising to assist him in whatever difficulties he might find himself.$
+Timothy associated the offer with the death of his father‚M-^@M-^Tmaybe they$
+were friends.$
+$
+He was shown into the sunny drawing-room bright with flowers, and he$
+looked round approvingly. He had lived in other people‚M-^@M-^Ys houses all his$
+life‚M-^@M-^Tschools, boarding-houses, hotels and the like‚M-^@M-^Tand an atmosphere$
+of home came to him like the forgotten fragrance of a garden he had$
+known.$
+$
+The servant came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will see you in ten minutes, sir, but you must not keep him$
+long, because he has to go out to meet Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in surprise, ‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know he was$
+married.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant smiled and said:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Judge married a year ago, sir. It was in all the newspapers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt read all the newspapers,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt sufficient$
+time. Who was the lady?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man looked round, as if fearing to be overheard.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John married the cinema lady, Miss Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and the$
+hostility in his tone was unmistakable.$
+$
+Timothy gasped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, that beats the band! Why, I knew that$
+da‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T, that lady in London!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The servant inclined his head sideways.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Indeed, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and it was evident that he did not regard$
+Timothy as being any fitter for human association by reason of his$
+confession.$
+$
+A distant bell buzzed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John is ready, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I hope you will not mention the fact$
+that I spoke of madam?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy winked, and was readmitted to the confidence of the democracy.$
+$
+Sir John Maxell was standing up behind his writing table, a fine, big$
+man with his grey hair neatly brushed back from his forehead and his$
+blue eyes magnified behind rimless glasses.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, coming round the table with slow steps.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely this is not the little Timothy I heard so much about years and$
+years ago!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is I, sir,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I should never have known you. Sit down, my$
+boy. You smoke, of course‚M-^@M-^Teverybody smokes nowadays, but it seems$
+strange that a boy I knew in short breeches should have acquired the$
+habit. I‚M-^@M-^Yve heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said, as Timothy lit his cigar.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nothing to my discredit, I hope, sir?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Maxell shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have heard about you,‚M-^@M-^] he repeated diplomatically, ‚M-^@M-^\let it go at$
+that. Now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve come here because, five years ago, on the$
+twenty-third of December to be correct, I wrote to you, offering to give$
+you any help that lay in my power.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I won‚M-^@M-^Yt swear to the date,‚M-^@M-^] said Tim.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But I will,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the other. ‚M-^@M-^\I never forget a date, I never forget a$
+letter, I never forget the exact wording of that letter. My memory is an$
+amazing gift. Now just tell me what I can do for you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I have had a pretty bad time in America. I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+running in a team with a crook and I‚M-^@M-^Yve had to pay out every cent I had$
+in the world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded slowly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then it is money you want,‚M-^@M-^] he said, without enthusiasm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not exactly money, sir, but I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to try to start in London and I$
+thought, maybe, you might give me a letter of introduction to somebody.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah, well,‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell, brightening up, ‚M-^@M-^\I think I can do that for you.$
+What did you think of doing in London?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought of getting some sort of secretarial job,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Not that$
+I know much about it!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John pinched his lower lip.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know a man who may help you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\We were in the House of$
+Commons together and he would give you a place in one of his offices,$
+but unfortunately for you he has made a great deal of money and spends$
+most of his time at Newmarket.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds good to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance$
+there. Perhaps he‚M-^@M-^Yd try me out in that office?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Judge permitted himself to smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In Newmarket,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\our friend does very little more, I fear, than$
+waste his time and money on the race-course. He has half a dozen$
+horses‚M-^@M-^TI had a letter from him this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked back to his table, searched in the litter, and presently$
+amongst the papers pulled out a letter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As a matter of fact, I had some business with him and I wrote to him$
+for information. The only thing he tells me is‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tthis with a gesture of$
+despair‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\that Skyball and Polly Chaw‚M-^@M-^Tthose are the names of$
+race-horses, I presume‚M-^@M-^Twill win the two big handicaps next week and$
+that he has a flyer named Swift Kate that can beat anything‚M-^@M-^TI am$
+quoting his words‚M-^@M-^Ton legs over six furlongs.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up over his glasses at Timothy, and on that young man‚M-^@M-^Ys face$
+was a seraphic smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds real nice to me,‚M-^@M-^] glowed Timothy.$
+$
+Remembering the injunctions of the servant, he was taking his adieu,$
+when his host asked, in a lower voice than that in which the$
+conversation had been carried on:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you have not heard from your cousin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at him in astonishment. Had Sir John asked after the$
+Grand Llama of Tibet he would have been as well prepared to answer.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, no, sir‚M-^@M-^Tno‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tis he alive?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John Maxell looked at him sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alive? Of course. I thought you might have heard from him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\he disappeared. I only met him once when I was a$
+kid. Was he a friend‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tan acquaintance of yours?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John was drumming his fingers on the desk and his mind was far away.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes and no,‚M-^@M-^] he said shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\I knew him, and at one time I was$
+friendly with him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly he glanced at his watch, and a look of consternation came to$
+his face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Great heavens!‚M-^@M-^] he cried. ‚M-^@M-^\I promised to meet my wife a quarter of an$
+hour ago. Good-bye! Good-bye!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He hand-shook Timothy from the room and the young man had to find his$
+way downstairs without guidance, because the manservant was at that$
+moment heavily engaged.$
+$
+From the floor below came a shrill, unpleasant sound, and Timothy$
+descended to find himself in the midst of a domestic crisis. There were$
+two ladies in the hall‚M-^@M-^Tone a mere silent, contained spectator, the$
+other the principal actress. He recognised her at once, but she did not$
+see him, because her attention was directed to the red-faced servant.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\When I ring you on the ‚M-^@M-^Yphone, I expect to be answered,‚M-^@M-^] she was$
+saying. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to do except to sit round and keep your ears$
+open, you big, lazy devil!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But, my lady, I‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt answer me,‚M-^@M-^] she stormed. ‚M-^@M-^\If you think I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing better to do$
+than to sit at a ‚M-^@M-^Yphone waiting till you wake up, why, you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+mistaken‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys all. And if Sir John doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt fire you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about Sir John firing me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man with a sudden$
+change of manner. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve just had about as much of you as I can stand.$
+You keep your bossing for the movies, Lady Maxell. You‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to$
+try any of that stuff with me!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was incapable of further speech, nor was there any necessity for it$
+since the man turned on his heels and disappeared into that mysterious$
+region which lies at the back of every entrance hall. Then for the first$
+time she saw Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How do you do, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She glared round at the interrupter, and for a moment he thought she$
+intended venting her anger on him. She was still frowning when he took$
+her limp hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre the Anderson boy, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked a little ungraciously.$
+$
+The old sense of antagonism was revived and intensified in him at the$
+touch of her hand. She was unchanged, looking, if anything, more pretty$
+than when he had seen her last, but the hardness at her mouth was$
+accentuated, and she had taken on an indefinable air of superiority$
+which differed very little from sheer insolence.$
+$
+A gold-rimmed lorgnette came up to survey him, and he was nettled‚M-^@M-^Tonly$
+women had the power to annoy him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt changed a bit,‚M-^@M-^] he bantered. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry your eyesight is$
+not so good as it was. Studio life is pretty tough on the eyes, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She closed her lorgnette with a snap, and turned to the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better see what Sir John is doing,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Ask him what he$
+thinks I am, that I should wait in the hall like a tramp.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was then that the girl came out of the shadow and Timothy saw her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is the ward or niece,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and sighed, for never$
+had he seen a human creature who so satisfied his eye. There is a beauty$
+which is neither statuesque nor cold, nor to be confounded with$
+prettiness. It is a beauty which depends upon no regularity of feature$
+or of colour, but which has its reason in its contradictions.$
+$
+The smiling Madonna whom Leonardo drew had such contradictory quality as$
+this girl possessed. For she was ninety per cent. child, and carried in$
+her face all the bubbling joy of youth. Yet she impressed Timothy as$
+being strange and unnatural. Her meekness, her ready obedience to carry$
+out the woman‚M-^@M-^Ys instruction, the very dignity of her departure‚M-^@M-^Tthese$
+things did not fit with the character he read in her face. Had she$
+turned curtly to this insolent woman and told her to carry her message$
+herself, or had she flown up the stairs calling for Sir John as she$
+went, these things would have been natural.$
+$
+Lady Maxell turned upon him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And see here, Mr. What‚M-^@M-^Ys-your-name, if you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of Sir John,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yll forget that I was ever in a studio. There are enough stories$
+about me in Bournemouth without your adding to the collection.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mother‚M-^@M-^Ys little thoroughbred!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy admiringly; ‚M-^@M-^\spoken like a$
+true little lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+In some respects he was wholly undisciplined, and had never learnt the$
+necessity of refraining from answering back. And the woman irritated$
+him, and irritation was a novel sensation.$
+$
+Her face was dark with rage, but it was upon Sir John, descending in$
+haste to meet his offended wife, that she turned the full batteries of$
+her anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know the time, of course. Your watch has stopped. It is hard$
+enough for me to keep my end up without you helping to make me look$
+foolish!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] protested Maxell in a flurry, ‚M-^@M-^\I assure you‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can spend your time with this sort of trash,‚M-^@M-^] she indicated$
+Timothy, and Timothy bowed, ‚M-^@M-^\but you keep me waiting like a tailor‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+model at Sotheby‚M-^@M-^Ys, of all people in the world, when you know well$
+enough‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] pleaded the lawyer wearily, ‚M-^@M-^\my watch has certainly$
+stopped‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! You make me tired. What are you doing with this fellow? Do you$
+think I want reminding of movie days? Everybody knows this fellow‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+cheap gambler, who‚M-^@M-^Ys been fired out of every studio in England. You$
+allow your servants to insult me‚M-^@M-^Tand now I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yve brought this$
+prize-fighter to keep me in my place,‚M-^@M-^] and she pointed scornfully at the$
+amused Timothy.$
+$
+Half-way downstairs the girl stood watching the scene in silence, and it$
+was only when he became conscious of her presence that Timothy began to$
+feel a little uncomfortable.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, good-bye, Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry I intruded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\John, this man has insulted me! I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know$
+what he‚M-^@M-^Ys come for, but I suppose he wants something. He‚M-^@M-^Ys one of those$
+shifty fellows that hang around studios begging for money to bet with.$
+If you raise a hand to help him, why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I assure you,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John in his most pompous manner, ‚M-^@M-^\that this$
+young man has asked for nothing more than a letter of introduction. I$
+have a duty‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop!‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve a duty to me, too. Hold fast to your$
+money. Likely as not, you‚M-^@M-^Yll do neither with ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson$
+floating around.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was not her words, neither the contempt in her voice nor the insult$
+which stung him. The man who went twenty rounds with Kid Muldoon had$
+learnt to control his temper, but there was a new factor present‚M-^@M-^Ta$
+factor who wore a plain grey dress, and had two big, black eyes which$
+were now solemnly surveying him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is pretty difficult to give the lie to any$
+woman, but I tell you that what you say now is utterly false. I had no$
+intention when I came to Bournemouth of asking for anything that would$
+cost Sir John a penny. As to my past, I suppose it has been a little$
+eccentric, but it is clean, Lady Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He meant no more than he said. He had no knowledge of Sadie O‚M-^@M-^YGrady‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+antecedents, or he might not have emphasised the purity of his own. But$
+the woman went back as though she had been whipped, and Timothy had a$
+momentary vision of a charging fury, before she flung herself upon him,$
+tearing at his face, shrieking aloud in her rage. . .$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He took off his hat and fanned himself. It was the first time he had$
+ever run away from trouble, but now he had almost flown. Those favoured$
+people who were in sight of Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys handsome villa, saw the$
+door swung open and a young man taking the front path in four strides$
+and the gate in another before he sped like the wind along the street.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Phew!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy again.$
+$
+He went the longest way back to his hotel, to find that a telephone$
+message had been received from Sir John. It was short and to the point.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt come again.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy read the slip and chuckled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it likely?‚M-^@M-^] he asked the page who brought the message.$
+$
+Then he remembered the girl in grey, with the dark eyes, and he fingered$
+his smooth chin thoughtfully.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wonder if it is worth while taking a chance,‚M-^@M-^] he said to himself, and$
+decided that, for the moment, it was not.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER X$
+$
+$
+LADY MAXELL yawned and put down the magazine she was reading. She$
+looked at her watch. It was ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock. At such an hour Paris would be$
+beginning to wake up. The best people would still be in the midst of$
+their dinner, and Marie de Montdidier (born Hopkins) would be putting$
+the final dabs of powder on her nose in her dressing-room at the Folies$
+Berg√®res before making her first and her final appearance.$
+$
+The boulevards would be bright with light, and there would be lines of$
+twinkling autos in the Bois for the late diners at the Aromonville. She$
+looked across at the girl sitting under a big lamp in a window recess, a$
+book on her knees, but her mind and eyes elsewhere.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and the girl, with a start, woke from her reverie.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you want me, Lady Maxell?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is the matter with Sir John? You know him better than I do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hardly know, Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt call me ‚M-^@M-^XLady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said the other$
+irritably. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve told you to call me Sadie if you want to.‚M-^@M-^] There was a$
+silence. ‚M-^@M-^\Evidently you don‚M-^@M-^Yt want,‚M-^@M-^] snapped the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre what I$
+call a fine, sociable family. You seem to get your manners from your new$
+friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl went red.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My new friend?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Lady Maxell turned her back to her with$
+some resolution and resumed for a moment the reading of her magazine.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt mind if you find any pleasure in talking to that kind of$
+insect,‚M-^@M-^] she said, putting the periodical down again. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, the world‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+full of those do-nothing boys. I suppose he knows there‚M-^@M-^Ys money coming$
+to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Very little, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A little‚M-^@M-^Ys a lot to a man like that,‚M-^@M-^] said the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+think I am prejudiced because I was‚M-^@M-^Ter‚M-^@M-^Tannoyed the other day. That is$
+temperament.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the girl smiled, but it was a different kind of smile, and Lady$
+Maxell observed it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You can marry him as far as I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\These sneaking$
+meetings are not exactly complimentary to Sir John, that‚M-^@M-^Ys all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl closed her book, walked across to the shelf and put it away$
+before she spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I suppose you‚M-^@M-^Yre speaking of Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I have met$
+him, but there has been nothing furtive in the meetings. He stopped me$
+in the park and apologised for having been responsible for the$
+scene‚M-^@M-^Tfor your temperament, you know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked up sharply, but the girl met her eyes without$
+wavering.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you aren‚M-^@M-^Yt trying to be sarcastic,‚M-^@M-^] complained the older woman.$
+‚M-^@M-^\One never knows how deep you are. But I can tell you this, that sarcasm$
+is wasted on me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sure of that,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl.$
+$
+Lady Maxell looked again, but apparently the girl was innocent of$
+offensive design.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say I met Mr. Anderson. He was very polite and very nice. Then I met$
+him again‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, I have met him several times,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+thoughtfully. ‚M-^@M-^\So far from his being a do-nothing, Lady Maxell, I think$
+you are doing him an injustice. He is working at the Parade Drug Store.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He will make a fine match for you,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John will just$
+love having a shop-walker in the family!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+That ended the conversation for both of them, and they sat reading for a$
+quarter of an hour before Lady Maxell threw her magazine on the floor$
+and got up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sir John had a telegram yesterday that worried him,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you$
+know what it was about?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Honestly I do not know, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Why don‚M-^@M-^Yt you ask$
+him yourself?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because he would tell me a lie,‚M-^@M-^] said the woman coolly, and the girl$
+winced.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He brought all his money and securities from the Dawlish and County$
+Bank to-day and put them in his safe and he had the chief constable with$
+him for half an hour this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This was news to the girl, and she was interested in spite of herself.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to be frank with$
+you‚M-^@M-^Tfrankness pays sometimes. They called my marriage a romance of the$
+screen. Every newspaper said as much and I suppose that is true. But the$
+most romantic part of the marriage was my estate in Honolulu, my big$
+house in Paris and my bank balance. Ellsberger‚M-^@M-^Ys publicity man put all$
+that stuff about, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve an idea that Sir John was highly disappointed$
+when he found he‚M-^@M-^Yd married me for myself alone. That‚M-^@M-^Ys how it strikes$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was a marriage which had shocked Society and had upset the smooth$
+current of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys life, placed in an entirely new light.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Aren‚M-^@M-^Yt you very rich?‚M-^@M-^] she asked slowly, and Sadie laughed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rich! There was a tram fare between me and the workhouse the day I$
+married Sir John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt blame him for being disappointed.$
+Lots of these cinema stars are worth millions‚M-^@M-^TI wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt one of them. I$
+married because I thought I was going to have a good time‚M-^@M-^Tlots of money$
+and plenty of travel‚M-^@M-^Tand I chose with my eyes shut.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl was silent. For once Sadie Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys complaint had$
+justification. Sir John Maxell was not a spending man. He lived well,$
+but never outside the circle of necessity.$
+$
+The girl was about to speak, when there came a dramatic interruption.$
+$
+There was a ‚M-^@M-^\whang!‚M-^@M-^] a splintering of glass and something thudded$
+against the wall. Lady Maxell stood up as white as death.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was that?‚M-^@M-^] she gasped.$
+$
+The girl was pale, but she did not lose her nerve.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Somebody fired a shot. Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She pulled aside the curtain. ‚M-^@M-^\The bullet went through the window.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Keep away from the window, you fool!‚M-^@M-^] screamed the woman. ‚M-^@M-^\Turn out the$
+light! Ring the bell!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mary moved across the room and turned the switch. They waited in$
+silence, but no other shot was fired. Perhaps it was an accident.$
+Somebody had been firing at a target. . . .$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Go and tell my husband!‚M-^@M-^] said Sadie. ‚M-^@M-^\Quickly!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl passed through the lighted hall upstairs and knocked at Sir$
+John‚M-^@M-^Ys door. There was no answer. She tried the door, but found it$
+locked. This was not unusual. He had a separate entrance to his study,$
+communicating by a balcony and a flight of stairs with the garden. A$
+wild fear seized her. Possibly Sir John had been in the garden when the$
+shot was fired; it may have been intended for him. She knocked again$
+louder, and this time she heard his step and the door was opened.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you knock before?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\I was writing‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Then he saw her face.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] he demanded.$
+$
+The girl told him, and he made his way downstairs slowly, as was his$
+wont. He entered the drawing-room, switched on the lights, and without a$
+glance at his wife walked to the window and examined the shattered pane.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I imagined I heard a noise, but thought somebody had dropped something.$
+When did this happen? Just before you came up?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+Maxell looked from one to the other. His wife was almost speechless with$
+terror, and Mary Maxell alone was calm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It has come already,‚M-^@M-^] he said musingly. ‚M-^@M-^\I did not think that this$
+would happen so soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked down to the hall where the telephone hung and rang through to$
+the police station, and the girl heard all he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, it is Sir John Maxell speaking. A shot has just been fired through$
+my window. No, not at me‚M-^@M-^TI was in my study. Apparently a rifle shot.$
+Yes, I was right‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Presently he came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The police will be here in a few moments to make a search of the$
+grounds,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I doubt whether they will catch the miscreant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it possible that it was an accident?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Accident?‚M-^@M-^] He smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] he said dryly. ‚M-^@M-^\That kind of$
+accident is liable to happen again. You had better come up to my study,$
+both of you, till the police arrive,‚M-^@M-^] he said and led the way up the$
+stairs.$
+$
+He did not attempt to support his wife, though her nerve was obviously$
+shaken. Possibly he did not observe this fact until they were in the$
+room, for after a glance at her face he pushed a chair forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+The study was the one room to which his wife was seldom admitted.$
+Dominated as he was by her in other matters, he was firm on this point.$
+It was perhaps something of a novelty for her‚M-^@M-^Ta novelty which will$
+still the whimper of the crying child has something of the same effect$
+upon a nervous woman.$
+$
+The door of the safe was open and the big table was piled high with$
+sealed packages. The only money she saw was a thick pad of bank-notes$
+fastened about with a paper bandage, on which something was written. On$
+this she fixed her eyes. She had never seen so much money in her life,$
+and he must have noticed the attention this display of wealth had$
+created, for he took up the money and slipped it into a large envelope.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is your money, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he beamed over his glasses at the girl.$
+$
+She was feeling the reaction of her experience now and was trembling in$
+every limb. Yet she thought she recognised in this diversion an attempt$
+on his part to soothe her, and she smiled and tried hard to respond.$
+$
+They had been daily companions since she was a mite of four, and between$
+him and his dead brother‚M-^@M-^Ys child there was a whole lot of understanding$
+and sympathy which other people never knew.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My money, uncle?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I realised your investments last week,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I happened to know$
+that the Corporation in which the money stood had incurred very heavy$
+losses through some error in insurance. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a great deal, but I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt afford to let you take any further risks.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There was, of course, a possibility of this shot having been fired by$
+accident,‚M-^@M-^] he went on, reverting to the matter which would naturally be$
+at the back of his mind. Then he fell into thought, pacing the room in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I thought you were out,‚M-^@M-^] he said, stopping suddenly in front of the$
+girl. ‚M-^@M-^\You told me you were going to a concert.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before she could explain why she changed her mind they heard the sound$
+of voices in the hall.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stay here,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John. ‚M-^@M-^\It is the police. I will go down and tell$
+them all there is to know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+When her husband had gone, Lady Maxell rose from her chair. The table,$
+with its sealed packages, drew her like a magnet. She fingered them one$
+by one, and came at last to the envelope containing Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys patrimony.$
+This she lifted in her hands, weighing it. Then, with a deep sigh, she$
+replaced the package on the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money there,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and Mary smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not a great deal, I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid. Father was comparatively poor when he$
+died.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys money,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell thoughtfully; ‚M-^@M-^\more than I have ever$
+seen since I have been in this house, believe me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She returned, as though fascinated, and lifted the envelope again and$
+peered inside.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor, was he?‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think you people don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what poverty$
+is. Do you know what all this means?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held the envelope up and there was a look in her face which the girl$
+had never seen before.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means comfort, it means freedom from worry, it means that you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have to pretend and make love to men whom you loathe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl had risen and was staring at her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lady Maxell!‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice. ‚M-^@M-^\Why‚M-^@M-^Twhy‚M-^@M-^TI never think of$
+money like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why should you?‚M-^@M-^] said the woman roughly, as she flung the package on$
+the table. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been after money in quantities like that all my life.$
+It has always been dangling in front of me and eluding me‚M-^@M-^Teluding is$
+the word, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked carelessly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are all those pictures?‚M-^@M-^] she changed the subject abruptly,$
+pointing to the framed photographs which covered the walls. ‚M-^@M-^\They‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+photographs of India, aren‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John was born in Morocco and lived there$
+until he went to school. He speaks Arabic like a native. Did you know$
+that?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Morocco,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys strange. Morocco!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know it?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been there‚M-^@M-^Tonce,‚M-^@M-^] replied the other shortly. ‚M-^@M-^\Did Sir John go$
+often?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Before he married, yes,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary. ‚M-^@M-^\He had large interests there at$
+one time, I think.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John came back at that moment, and Mary noticed that his first$
+glance was at the table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, they‚M-^@M-^Yve found nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\neither footprints nor the$
+empty shell. They‚M-^@M-^Yre making a search of the grounds to-morrow. Lebbitter$
+wanted to post a man to protect the house in view of the other matter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What other matter?‚M-^@M-^] asked his wife quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\nothing really which concerns you. Of course,$
+I would not allow the police to do that. It would make the house more$
+conspicuous than it is at present.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked at the two.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now,‚M-^@M-^] he said bluntly, ‚M-^@M-^\I think you had better go off to bed. I have$
+still a lot of work to do.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His wife obeyed without a word, and the girl was following her, when he$
+called her back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym afraid I‚M-^@M-^Ym not$
+the best man that ever lived, but I‚M-^@M-^Yve tried to make you happy, my dear,$
+in my own way. You‚M-^@M-^Yve been as a daughter to me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked up at him with shining eyes. She could not trust herself to$
+speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Things haven‚M-^@M-^Yt gone as well as they might during the past year,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\I made a colossal blunder, but I made it with my eyes open. It$
+hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt been pleasant for either of us, but there‚M-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
+regretting what you cannot mend. Mary, they tell me that you‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+seeing a lot of this young man Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was annoyed to find herself going red when there was really no$
+reason for it. She need not ask who ‚M-^@M-^\they‚M-^@M-^] were, she could guess.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been making inquiries about that boy,‚M-^@M-^] said Sir John slowly, ‚M-^@M-^\and$
+I can tell you this, he is straight. Perhaps he has led an$
+unconventional life, but all that he told Sadie was true. He‚M-^@M-^Ys clean,$
+and, Mary, that counts for something in this world.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He seemed at a loss how to proceed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anything might happen,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Although I‚M-^@M-^Ym not an old man, I$
+have enemies. . . .‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have many enemies,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Some of them are hateful, and I want to$
+tell you this, that if trouble ever comes and that boy is within$
+call‚M-^@M-^Tgo to him. I know men, good, bad and indifferent; he‚M-^@M-^Ys neither bad$
+nor indifferent. And now, good night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He kissed her on the forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You needn‚M-^@M-^Yt tell your aunt what I‚M-^@M-^Yve been talking about,‚M-^@M-^] he said at$
+parting and led her to the door, closing and locking it behind her.$
+$
+He sat down in his chair for a very long time before he made a move,$
+then he began picking up the packages and carrying them to the safe. He$
+stopped half-way through and resumed his seat in the chair, waiting for$
+the hour to pass, by which time he judged the household would be asleep.$
+$
+At midnight he took a pair of rubber boots from a locker, pulled them$
+on, and went out through the door leading to the balcony, down the$
+covered stairway to the garden. Unerringly he walked across the lawn to$
+a corner of his grounds which his gardeners had never attempted to$
+cultivate. He stopped once and groped about in the bushes for a spade$
+which he had carefully planted there a few nights before. His hand$
+touched the rotting wood of an older spade and he smiled. For six years$
+the tool had remained where he had put it the last time he had visited$
+this No-Man‚M-^@M-^Ys-Land.$
+$
+Presently he came to a little hillock and began digging. The soil was$
+soft, and he had not gone far before the spade struck wood. He cleared a$
+space two feet square and drew from the earth a small crescent of wood.$
+It was, in fact, a part of the wooden cover of a well which had long$
+since gone dry but which had been covered up by its previous owner and$
+again covered by Maxell.$
+$
+Lying at full length on the ground, he reached down through the$
+aperture, and his fingers found a big rusty nail on which was suspended$
+a length of piano wire. At the end of the wire was attached a small$
+leather bag and this he drew up and unfastened, and putting the bag on$
+one side, let the free end of the wire fall into the well.$
+$
+He replaced the wood, covered it again with earth, all the time$
+exercising care, for, small as the aperture was, it was big enough for$
+even a man of his size to slip through.$
+$
+A cloaked figure which stood in the shadow of the bushes watching him,$
+which had followed him as noiselessly across the lawn, saw him lift the$
+bag and take it back to the house and disappear through the covered$
+stairway. So still a night it was, that the watcher could hear the click$
+of the lower door as Sir John locked it, and the soft pad of his feet as$
+they mounted the stairs.$

+$
+$
+MR. GOLDBERG, the manager and proprietor of the Parade Drug Store, was$
+a man who possessed neither a sense of imagination nor the spirit of$
+romance. He sent peremptorily for Timothy, and Timothy came with a$
+feeling that all was not well.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said Goldberg in his best magisterial manner, ‚M-^@M-^\I took$
+you into my shop because I was short of a man and because I understood$
+that you had had some business experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have business experience,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy carefully, ‚M-^@M-^\of a kind.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I gave you particular instructions,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\on$
+one very vital point. We carry a full line of all the best proprietorial$
+medicines, and our customers can always get them upon application. Each$
+of those medicines we duplicate, as you know, providing the same$
+constituents and charging some sixpence to a shilling less‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, we$
+are out to save the public from being robbed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I understand you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I don‚M-^@M-^Yt see much difference$
+between robbing the public and robbing the patent medicine proprietors,$
+and all that just-as-good stuff never did impress me, anyway. It stands$
+to reason,‚M-^@M-^] he said, leaning over the desk and speaking with the$
+earnestness of a crusader, ‚M-^@M-^\that the advertised article must be more$
+even in quality and it must be good all round. You can‚M-^@M-^Yt advertise a bad$
+article and get away with it, except on the first sale, and that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+pay the advertiser. The goods sell the goods, and the advertisement is$
+only to make you take the first lick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I do not want a lecture on advertising or on commercial morality,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Mr. Goldberg with ominous calm. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely want to tell you that you were$
+overheard by my chief assistant telling a customer not to ‚M-^@M-^Xtake a$
+chance‚M-^@M-^Y on one of my own pills.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys right,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, nodding his head vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Guilty, my$
+lord. What about it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have had a further complaint,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg, consulting with$
+elaborate ceremony a little notebook. ‚M-^@M-^\I understand that you have$
+initiated the awful practice of offering to toss customers for their$
+change. People have written me strong letters of complaint about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because they lost,‚M-^@M-^] said the indignant Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\what‚M-^@M-^Ys wrong about$
+that, anyway, Mr. Goldberg? I don‚M-^@M-^Yt pocket the money, and I win twice$
+out of every three times. If a fellow likes to take a chance as to$
+whether he gets sixpence or we get a shilling, why worry?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The outraged Mr. Goldberg brindled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sort of thing may be all right at a country fair or even in a$
+country shop,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not good enough for the Parade Drug$
+Store, Bournemouth, and I‚M-^@M-^Yll dispense with your services as from this$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre losing a good man,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, but Mr. Goldberg did$
+not seem to take that loss to heart.$
+$
+All ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] jobs ended violently. He never conceived$
+of them ending in any other way, and invariably regarded the sum of$
+money which was received in lieu of notice, or as compensation for$
+breach of contract, as being something in the nature of a nest-egg which$
+a kindly Providence had foreordained, and he was neither cast down nor$
+elated by the crisis in his affairs when, by a fortunate accident, he$
+met Mary Maxell‚M-^@M-^Tthe fortune was apparent, but the accident belonged to$
+the category which determined the hour at which trains leave stations.$
+$
+Hitherto, on the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys part, these meetings had been fraught with a$
+certain amount of apprehension, if not terror. They had begun when$
+Timothy had stopped her on the morning after his quarrel with Lady$
+Maxell, and had made bland inquiries as to that lady‚M-^@M-^Ys condition. Then$
+she had been in a panic and frantically anxious to end the interview,$
+and it required all her self-restraint to prevent her flying at top$
+speed from this wicked young man who had been so abominably rude.$
+$
+At their second meeting he had greeted her as an old friend, and she had$
+left him with the illusion of a life-time acquaintance. Hereafter$
+matters went smoothly, and they went so because Timothy Anderson was$
+unlike any of the other boys she had ever met.$
+$
+He paid her no compliments, he did not grow sentimental, he neither$
+tried to hold her hand nor kiss her, nor was he ever oppressed by that$
+overwhelming melancholy which is the heritage and pride of youth.$
+$
+Not once did he hint at an early decline or the possibility of his going$
+away to die in far lands. Instead he kept her in screams of laughter at$
+his interpretation of movie plays in the making. He did not ask for a$
+keepsake; the only request he made of her in this direction was one$
+which first took her breath away. Thereafter she never met him unless$
+she had in the bag which slung from her wrist one small box of matches;$
+for ‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson had never possessed or carried the means of$
+ignition for his cigarette for one whole hour together.$
+$
+Timothy told her most of what the proprietor of the Parade Drug Store$
+had told him. The girl thought it was a joke, because that was exactly$
+the way Timothy presented the matter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you won‚M-^@M-^Yt be going away soon?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not till I go abroad,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy calmly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you going abroad too?‚M-^@M-^] she asked in surprise.$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to Paris and Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^Tespecially to Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\and afterwards I may run across to Algeria or to Egypt.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him with a new respect. She was less impressed by the$
+great possessions which his plans betrayed than by his confident$
+independence, and dimly she wondered why he was working at a drug-store$
+for low wages and wondered, too, whether he was‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you blushing about?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy curiously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt blushing,‚M-^@M-^] she protested; ‚M-^@M-^\I was just wondering whether I$
+could ever afford a trip like that.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course you can,‚M-^@M-^] said the young man scornfully. ‚M-^@M-^\If I can afford it,$
+you can, can‚M-^@M-^Yt you? If I go abroad and stay at the best hotels, and go$
+joy rides in the Alps and plan all this when I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got fifteen$
+shillings over my rent‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt fifteen shillings over your rent!‚M-^@M-^] she repeated, aghast.$
+‚M-^@M-^\But how can you go abroad without money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was genuinely astounded that she could ask so absurd a question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\A little thing like money$
+doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt really count.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre very silly,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, there was something I wanted$
+to tell you, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You may call me Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to call you Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she replied.$
+$
+He shook his head with a pained expression.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It‚M-^@M-^Yll be ever so much more sociable if you call me Timothy and I call$
+you Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We can be very sociable without that familiarity,‚M-^@M-^] she said severely.$
+‚M-^@M-^\I was just going to tell you something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They sat on the grass together, on the shadow fringe of a big oak and$
+the spring sunshine wove its restless arabesques on her lap.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know,‚M-^@M-^] she said after a pause, ‚M-^@M-^\that last night I had two queer$
+experiences and I was scared; oh, scared to death!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eating things at night,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy oracularly, ‚M-^@M-^\especially before$
+you go to bed‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt dreaming,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly, ‚M-^@M-^\nor was it a nightmare. I$
+won‚M-^@M-^Yt tell you if you‚M-^@M-^Yre so horrid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym only speaking as an ex-chemist and druggist,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gravely;$
+‚M-^@M-^\but please forgive me. Tell me what it is, Mary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Mary Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] he compromised.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\First I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the least worst,‚M-^@M-^] she began. ‚M-^@M-^\It happened about one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock in the morning. I had gone to bed awfully tired, but somehow I$
+couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt sleep, so I got up and walked about the room. I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt like$
+putting on the light because that meant drawing down the blinds which I$
+had let up when I went to bed, and the blinds make such a noise that I$
+thought the whole of the house would hear. So I put on my dressing-gown$
+and sat by the window. It was rather chilly, but my wrap was warm, and$
+sitting there I dozed. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know how long, but it was nearly an hour,$
+I think. When I woke up I saw a man right in the centre of the lawn.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was interested.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What sort of a man?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is the peculiar thing about it,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt a white$
+man.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A coon?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I think it must have been a Moor. He wore a long white dress that$
+reached down to his ankles, and over that he had a big, heavy black$
+cloak.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He went round the corner of the house towards uncle‚M-^@M-^Ys private stairway$
+and he was gone quite a long time. My first thought was to awaken uncle$
+and tell him, but then I remembered that Sir John had spent a long time$
+in Morocco and possibly he knew that the man was about the house. You$
+see, we have had Moorish visitors before, when ships have come to Poole.$
+Once we had a very important man, a Kaid, and Sir John made queer tea$
+for him in glasses with mint and stuff. So I just didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know what to$
+do. Whilst I was wondering whether I ought not at least to wake Lady$
+Maxell, he reappeared, walked across the lawn and went down the path$
+which leads to the back entrance‚M-^@M-^Tyou‚M-^@M-^Yre laughing at me,‚M-^@M-^] she said$
+suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What you mistake for a laugh,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\is merely one$
+large smile of pleasure at being in your confidence.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was in two minds as to whether she would be angry or pleased, but$
+his tone changed to a more serious one.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt like the idea of the gaudy East wandering loose under your$
+bedroom window in the middle of the night,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell Lady$
+Maxell this morning?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, she was up very early and has been out all day. I have not seen$
+her‚M-^@M-^Tin fact, she was not at breakfast. Now I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell you the really$
+serious thing that happened, and I do hope, Mr. Anderson, that you won‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+be flippant.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Trust me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl had no reason to complain of his attitude when she had$
+described the shooting incident. He was aghast.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is terrible!‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, it might have hit you!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course it might have hit me,‚M-^@M-^] she said indignantly. ‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys the$
+whole point of my story, so far as you are concerned‚M-^@M-^TI mean, so far as$
+I am concerned,‚M-^@M-^] she added hastily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So fax as I am concerned too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\I just hate the$
+idea of anything even frightening you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She rose hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am going to shop now,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys the hurry?‚M-^@M-^] grumbled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ignoring his question, ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt want you to$
+think that uncle is feeling badly about you because of what has happened$
+in the house. He spoke to me of you last night, and he spoke very$
+nicely. I am worried to death about Sir John. He has made enemies in his$
+life, and I am sure that this shooting affair is the sequel to some old$
+feud.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I should say that is so,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+He looked down at the grass very thoughtfully and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll go home,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I had better sleep this afternoon if I$
+am to be up all night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Up all night?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\What is happening? Is there a$
+ball or something?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There will be something livelier than a ball,‚M-^@M-^] he said grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if I$
+find anybody in your garden to-night. And Miss Maxell, if you look out$
+of your window and you see a solitary figure on sentry-go don‚M-^@M-^Yt shoot,$
+because it will be me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] she gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\Please don‚M-^@M-^Yt do it, Mr. Anderson. Uncle$
+would be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped her with a gesture.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Possibly nobody will come to-night,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and as likely as not I$
+shall be pinched by the police as a suspicious character. But there‚M-^@M-^Ys a$
+chance that somebody will come, and that‚M-^@M-^Ys the chance I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to$
+take.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XII$
+$
+$
+TRUE to his word, he returned to his lodgings and spent the afternoon$
+in slumber. He had the gift which all great men possess, of being able$
+to sleep at will. He was staying at a boarding-house, and occupied a$
+room which had originally been a side veranda, but had been walled in$
+and converted into an extra bedroom. It was a remarkably convenient room$
+for him, as he had discovered on previous occasions. He had but to open$
+the window and drop on to the grass to make his exit without anybody in$
+the house being the wiser. More to the point, he could return at any$
+hour by the same route without disturbing the household.$
+$
+He had his supper, and whilst it was still very light he went out to$
+reconnoitre Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys demesne. He was able to make the circuit of the$
+house, which occupied a corner site and was isolated by two lanes, and$
+he saw nobody until, returning to the front of the house, a car drove up$
+and a woman alighted.$
+$
+He had no difficulty in recognising Lady Maxell, but the taxi interested$
+him more than the lady. It was smothered with mud and had evidently come$
+a long journey.$
+$
+As evidently she had hired it in some distant town and she had not as$
+yet finished with it, because she gave the man some directions and$
+money, and from the profound respect which the chauffeur showed, it was$
+clear that that money was merely a tip.$
+$
+Timothy stood where he could clearly be seen, but her back was toward$
+him all the time and she did not so much as glance in his direction when$
+she passed through the gate and up the garden path.$
+$
+It was curious, thought Timothy, that she did not take the car up the$
+drive to the house. More curious was it that she should, at this late$
+hour of the evening, have further use for it.$
+$
+He returned to his room, full of theories, the majority of which were$
+wholly wild and improbable. He lay on his bed, indulging in those dreams$
+which made up the happiest part of his life. Of late he had taken a new$
+and a more radiant pattern to the web of his fancy and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, fiddlesticks!‚M-^@M-^] he said in disgust, rolling over and sitting up with$
+a yawn.$
+$
+He heard the feet of the boarders on the gravel path outside, and once$
+he heard a girl say evidently to a visitor:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you see that funny room! That is Mr. Anderson‚M-^@M-^Ys.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was still an hour or so to be passed, and he joined the party in$
+the parlour so restless and distrait as to attract attention and a$
+little mild raillery from his fellow guests. He went back to his room,$
+turned on the light and pulled a trunk from under the bed.$
+$
+Somehow his mind had been running all day upon that erring cousin whose$
+name he bore and whose disappearance from public life was such a$
+mystery. Possibly it was Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys words which had brought Alfred$
+Cartwright to his mind. His mother had left him a number of family$
+documents, which, with the indolence of youth, he had never examined$
+very closely. He had the impression that they consisted in the main of$
+receipts, old diplomas of his father‚M-^@M-^Ys (who was an engineer) and sundry$
+other family documents which were not calculated to excite the curiosity$
+of the adventurous youth.$
+$
+He took out the two big envelopes in which these papers were kept and$
+turned them on to the bed, examining them one by one. Why his cousin$
+should be in his mind, why he should have taken this action at that$
+particular moment, the psychologist and the psychical expert alone can$
+explain. They may produce in explanation such esoteric phenomena as$
+auras, influences, and telepathies, and perhaps they are right.$
+$
+He had not searched long before he came upon a small package of$
+newspaper cuttings, bound about by a rubber band. He read them at first$
+without interest, and then without comprehension. There was one cutting,$
+however, which had been clipped from its context, which seemed to tell$
+the whole story of the rest. It ran:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\When Cartwright stood up for sentence he did not seem to be$
+    greatly troubled by his serious position. As the words ‚M-^@M-^Xtwenty$
+    years‚M-^@M-^Y passed Mr. Justice Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys lips, he fell back as if he$
+    had been shot. Then, springing to the edge of the dock, he$
+    hurled an epithet at his lordship. Some of his business$
+    associates suggest that the learned judge was a partner of$
+    Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^Tan astonishing and most improper suggestion to$
+    make. In view of the statement that the prisoner made before the$
+    trial, when suggestions had been made in a newspaper that the$
+    judge had been connected with him in business years before, and$
+    remembering that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys statement was to the effect that$
+    he had had no business transactions with the judge, it seems as$
+    though the outburst was made in a fit of spleen at the severity$
+    of the sentence. Sir John Maxell, after the case, took the$
+    unusual step of informing a Press representative that he$
+    intended placing his affairs in the hands of a committee for$
+    investigation, and had invited the Attorney-General to appoint$
+    that committee. ‚M-^@M-^XI insist upon this being done,‚M-^@M-^Y he said,$
+    ‚M-^@M-^Xbecause after the prisoner‚M-^@M-^Ys accusation I should not feel$
+    comfortable until an impartial committee had examined my$
+    affairs.‚M-^@M-^Y It is understood that after the investigation the$
+    learned judge intends retiring from the Bench.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy gasped. So that was the explanation. That was why Maxell had$
+written to him, that was why he made no reference at all to his father,$
+but to this disreputable cousin of his. Slowly he returned the package$
+to its envelope, dropped it into his trunk and pushed the trunk under$
+the bed.$
+$
+And that was the secret of Cousin Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys disappearance. He might$
+have guessed it; he might even have known had he troubled to look at$
+these papers.$
+$
+He sat on the bed, his hands clasping his knees. It was not a pleasant$
+reflection that he had a relative, and a relative moreover after whom he$
+was named, serving what might be a life sentence in a convict$
+establishment. But what made him think of the matter to-night?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson! Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round with a start. The man whose face was framed in the$
+open window might have been forty, fifty or sixty. It was a face heavily$
+seamed and sparsely bearded‚M-^@M-^Ta hollow-eyed, hungry face, but those eyes$
+burnt like fire. Timothy jumped up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo!‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Who are you ‚M-^@M-^XTimothying‚M-^@M-^Y?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] the man laughed unpleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Can I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, you can come in,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He wondered what old acquaintance this was who had come to the tramp$
+level, and rapidly turned over in his mind all the possible candidates$
+for trampdom he had met.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the man again. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yve tracked you$
+here, and I‚M-^@M-^Yve been sitting in those bushes for two hours. I heard one$
+of the boarders say that it was your window and I waited till it was$
+dark before I came out.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\All this is highly interesting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, surveying the shrunken$
+figure without enthusiasm, ‚M-^@M-^\but who are you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had a provisional pardon,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and they put me in a$
+sanatorium‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Yve something the matter with one of my lungs. It was$
+always a trouble to me. I was supposed to stay in the sanatorium‚M-^@M-^Tthat$
+was one of the terms on which I was pardoned‚M-^@M-^Tbut I escaped.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy stared at him with open mouth.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Alfred Cartwright!‚M-^@M-^] he breathed.$
+$
+The man nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys me,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+Timothy looked down at the edge of the black box.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that is why I was thinking about you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, this beats$
+all! Sit down, won‚M-^@M-^Yt you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He pulled a chair up for his visitor and again gazed on him with$
+curiosity but without affection. Something in Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys attitude annoyed$
+Cartwright.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not glad to see me?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not very,‚M-^@M-^] admitted Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\The truth is, you‚M-^@M-^Yve only just come into$
+existence so far as I am concerned. I thought you were dead.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You didn‚M-^@M-^Yt know?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not until a few minutes ago. I was reading the cuttings about your$
+trial‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that was what you were reading?‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yd like to see ‚M-^@M-^Yem$
+one of these days. Do you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve come for?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was only at that moment that Sir John flashed through Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys mind.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I guess what you‚M-^@M-^Yve come after,‚M-^@M-^] he said slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre here to see$
+Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym here to see Mister Justice Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man between his teeth.$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre a good guesser.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took the stump of a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lit it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\John Maxell and I have a score to settle, and it is going to be settled$
+very soon.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tide and weather permitting,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy flippantly, recovering his$
+self-possession. ‚M-^@M-^\All that vendetta stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt go, Mr. Cartwright.‚M-^@M-^]$
+Then he asked in a flash: ‚M-^@M-^\Did you shoot at him last night?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise was a convincing reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shoot at him? I only got to this place this afternoon. It‚M-^@M-^Ys more likely$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys waiting to shoot at me, for the sanatorium people will have$
+telegraphed to him the moment I was missing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy walked to the window and pulled down the blinds.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now tell me, Mr. Cartwright, before we go any farther, do you still$
+persist in the story you told the court, that the judge was a party to$
+your swindle?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A party to it!‚M-^@M-^] said the other man furiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course he was! I was$
+using the money of my companies to buy concessions from the Moorish$
+Government, as much on his behalf as on mine. He wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt in the Brigot$
+swindle‚M-^@M-^Tbut he held shares in the company I was financing. We located a$
+gold mine in the Angera country, and Maxell and I went across to Europe$
+every year regularly to look after our property.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We had to keep it quiet because we secured the concessions from the$
+Pretender, knowing that he‚M-^@M-^Yd put the Sultan out of business the moment$
+he got busy. If it had been known, the Sultan would have repudiated the$
+concession, and our Government would have upheld the repudiation. Maxell$
+speaks the language like a native, and I learnt enough to get on with El$
+Mograb, who is the biggest thing amongst the rebel tribes. El Mograb$
+wanted us to stay there, Maxell and I; he‚M-^@M-^Yd have made us shereefs or$
+pashas, and I‚M-^@M-^Yd have done it, because I knew there was going to be an$
+investigation sooner or later into the affairs of my companies. But$
+Maxell wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt have it. He always pretended that, so far as he knew, my$
+financing was straight. You know the rest,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\When I came before$
+Maxell, I thought I was safe.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John allowed his affairs to be inspected,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\If he$
+had been engaged with you in this Morocco business, there must have been$
+papers to prove it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright laughed harshly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course he‚M-^@M-^Yd allow his affairs to be investigated,‚M-^@M-^] he sneered. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you think that old fox couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt _cache_ all the documents that put him$
+wrong? Papers? Why, he must have enough papers to hang him, if you could$
+only find ‚M-^@M-^Yem!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+There was one thing he was determined that this man should _not_ do, and$
+that was to disturb the peace of mind, not of Sir John Maxell or his$
+wife, but of a certain goddess whose bedroom overlooked the lawn.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What am I going to do?‚M-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. ‚M-^@M-^\Why, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going up to get$
+my share. And he‚M-^@M-^Yll be lucky if that‚M-^@M-^Ys all he loses. One of the mines$
+was sold to a syndicate last year‚M-^@M-^TI had news of it in gaol. He didn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+get much for it because he was in a hurry to sell‚M-^@M-^TI suppose his other$
+investments must have been going wrong twelve months ago‚M-^@M-^Tbut I want my$
+share of that!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you had best see Sir John in the morning. I will arrange an$
+interview.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In the morning!‚M-^@M-^] said the other contemptuously. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose you make the$
+arrangement, what would happen? When I went up there I should find a$
+couple of cops waiting to pinch me. I know John! I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think not,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and the man stared at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You think not?‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\What has it to do with you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite a lot,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I merely state that you will not see him$
+to-night.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Cartwright stroked his bristly chin undecidedly and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, well,‚M-^@M-^] he said in a milder tone, ‚M-^@M-^\maybe you can fix things up for$
+me in the morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where are you sleeping to-night?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had money, a little; and he had arranged to sleep at the house of a$
+man he had known in better times. Timothy accompanied him through the$
+window and into the street, and walked with him to the end of the road.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If my gamble had come off, you‚M-^@M-^Yd have benefited, Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+man unexpectedly, breaking in upon another topic which they were$
+discussing.$
+$
+They parted, and Timothy watched him out of sight, then turned on and$
+walked in the opposite direction, to take up his self-imposed vigil.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIII$
+$
+$
+THERE was something in the air that was electrical, and Mary Maxell$
+felt it as she sat at supper with Sir John and his wife. Maxell was$
+unusually silent and his wife amazingly so. She was nervous and almost$
+jumped when a remark was addressed to her. The old truculence which$
+distinguished her every word and action, her readiness to take offence,$
+to see a slight in the most innocent remark, and her combativeness$
+generally, had disappeared; she was almost meek when she replied to her$
+husband‚M-^@M-^Ys questions.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just went round shopping and then decided to call on a girl I had$
+known a long time ago. She lives in the country, and I felt so nervous$
+and depressed this morning that I thought a ride in a taxi would do me$
+good.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you take our car?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt decide until the last moment to go out to her, and then I went$
+by train one way.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Sir John nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym glad you went into the fresh air,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it will do you good.$
+The country is not so beautiful as Honolulu, but it is not without its$
+attractions.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was unusual for the Judge to be sarcastic, but it was less usual for$
+Lady Maxell to accept sarcasm without a retort. To Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys surprise she$
+made no reply, though a faint smile curved those straight lips of hers$
+for a second.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it was a burglar last night?‚M-^@M-^] she asked suddenly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good heavens, no!‚M-^@M-^] said Maxell. ‚M-^@M-^\Burglars do not shoot up the house$
+they burgle.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think it is safe to have all this money in the house?‚M-^@M-^] she$
+asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perfectly safe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that need alarm you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+No further reference was made to the matter, and presently Sir John went$
+up to his study. Mrs. Maxell did not go to the parlour, but drew a chair$
+to the fire in the dining-room and read, and the girl followed her$
+example. Presently the elder woman left the room and was gone a quarter$
+of an hour before she returned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] she said, so sweetly that the girl was startled, ‚M-^@M-^\such an$
+annoying thing has happened‚M-^@M-^TI have lost the key of my wardrobe. You$
+borrowed one of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicates the other day‚M-^@M-^Twhere did you put$
+the ring?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+John Maxell was a methodical and systematic man. He had a duplicate set$
+of all the keys in the house, and these as a rule were kept in a small$
+wall-safe in his own bedroom. He had never invited his wife to use that$
+receptacle, but she had a shrewd idea that the combination which was$
+denied to her had been given to the girl.$
+$
+Mary hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think if you asked Uncle‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My dear,‚M-^@M-^] smiled the lady, ‚M-^@M-^\if I went to him now, he‚M-^@M-^Yd never forgive$
+me. If you know where the keys are, be an angel and get them for me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl rose, and Lady Maxell followed her upstairs. Her own room was$
+next to her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys and communicated, but the door was invariably$
+locked on Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys side. Presently the girl came in to her.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here they are,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Please let me put them back quickly. I feel$
+very guilty at having taken them at all without his permission.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And for goodness‚M-^@M-^Y sake don‚M-^@M-^Yt tell him,‚M-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, examining the$
+keys.$
+$
+At last she found the one she wanted, but was a long time in the$
+process. She opened her bureau and the girl took the big key-ring from$
+her hand with such evident relief that Lady Maxell laughed.$
+$
+It had been easier than she thought and unless she made a blunder, the$
+key she had selected from the bunch while she was fumbling at the$
+bureau, would make just the difference‚M-^@M-^Tjust the difference.$
+$
+It was not customary for Sir John to come down from his study to enjoy$
+the ladies‚M-^@M-^Y company after dinner, but on this evening he made an$
+exception to his rule. He found his wife and ward reading, one on each$
+side of the fireplace. Lady Maxell looked up when her husband came in.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a curious story, John,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I think it must be an$
+American story, about a woman who robbed her husband and the police$
+refused to arrest her.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys nothing curious about that,‚M-^@M-^] said the lawyer, ‚M-^@M-^\in law a wife$
+cannot rob her husband or a husband his wife.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So that if you came to my Honolulu estate and stole my pearls,‚M-^@M-^] she$
+said banteringly, ‚M-^@M-^\I could not have you arrested.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Except for walking in my sleep!‚M-^@M-^] he said smilingly, and they both$
+laughed together.$
+$
+He had never seen her so amiable, and for the first time that day‚M-^@M-^Tit$
+had been a very trying and momentous day‚M-^@M-^The had his misgivings. She,$
+with the memory of her good day‚M-^@M-^Ys work, the excellent terms she had$
+arranged with the skipper of the _Lord Lawrence_, due to leave$
+Southampton for Cadiz at daylight the next morning, had no misgivings at$
+all, especially when she thought of a key she had placed under her$
+pillow. She had had the choice of two boats, the _Lord Lawrence_ and the$
+_Saffi_, but the _Saffi‚M-^@M-^Ys_ voyage would have been a long one, and its$
+port of destination might hold discomfort which she had no wish to$
+experience.$
+$
+The household retired at eleven o‚M-^@M-^Yclock, and it was past midnight before$
+Sadie Maxell heard her husband‚M-^@M-^Ys door close, and half an hour later$
+before the click of the switch told her that his light had been$
+extinguished.$
+$
+He was a ready sleeper, but she gave him yet another half-hour before$
+she opened the door of her bedroom and stepped out into the black$
+corridor. She moved noiselessly towards the study, her only fear being$
+that the baronet had locked the door before he came out. But this fear$
+was not well founded, and the door yielded readily to her touch. She was$
+dressed, and carried only a small attach√© case filled with the bare$
+necessities for the voyage.$
+$
+She pushed the catch of her electric lamp, located the safe and opened$
+it with no difficulty. She found herself surprisingly short of breath,$
+and her heart beat at such a furious rate that she thought it must be$
+audible to everybody in the house. The envelope with the money lay at$
+the bottom of the others, and she transferred its contents to her$
+attach√© case in a few seconds.$
+$
+Then her heart stood still. . . .$
+$
+It was only the faintest creak she heard, but it came from a corner of$
+the room where the door leading to the cupboard stairway was placed. She$
+saw a faint grey line of light appear‚M-^@M-^Tthe stairway had a glass roof and$
+admitted enough light to show her that the door was slowly opening. She$
+had to bite her lips to stop herself from screaming. To make her escape$
+or to rouse Sir John was impossible, and she opened the attach√© case$
+again, and with trembling fingers felt for the little revolver which she$
+had taken from her drawer. She felt safer now, yet she had not the$
+courage to switch on the light.$
+$
+She saw the figure of a man silhouetted in the opening, then the door$
+closed, and her terror bred of itself a certain courage.$
+$
+She flashed the light full on his face. The dead silence was broken when$
+she whispered:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, God! Benson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who‚M-^@M-^Ys that?‚M-^@M-^] he whispered, and snatched the torch from her hand.$
+$
+He looked at her long and curiously, and then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I expected to find that Maxell had taken most of my possessions,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I never thought he would take my wife!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us see what all this is about,‚M-^@M-^] boomed the big voice of John Maxell$
+almost in the man‚M-^@M-^Ys ear, he was so close, and suddenly the room was$
+flooded with light.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIV$
+$
+$
+THE self-appointed watcher found time pass very slowly. Twelve and one$
+o‚M-^@M-^Yclock struck from a distant church, but there was no sign of midnight$
+assassins, and the house, looking very solemn and quiet in the light of$
+a waning moon, irritated and annoyed him. From the roadway where he$
+paced silently to and fro‚M-^@M-^The had taken the precaution of wearing a pair$
+of rubber-soled shoes‚M-^@M-^The could glimpse Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys window, and once he$
+thought he saw her looking out.$
+$
+He made a point of walking entirely round the house twice in every hour,$
+and it was on one of these excursions that he heard a sound which$
+brought him to a standstill. It was a sound like two pieces of flat$
+board being smacked together sharply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Tap . . . tap!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and listened, but heard nothing further. Then he retraced his$
+footsteps to the front of the house and waited, but there was no sound$
+or sign. Another half-hour passed, and then a patrolling policeman came$
+along on the other side of the roadway. At the sight of the young man he$
+crossed the road, and Jim recognised an acquaintance of his drug-store$
+days. Nothing was to be gained by being evasive or mysterious, and$
+Timothy told the policeman frankly his object.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I heard about the shooting last night,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\and the$
+inspector offered to put one of our men on duty here, but Sir John$
+wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt hear of it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He took a professional look at the house, and pointed to its dark upper$
+windows.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That house is asleep‚M-^@M-^Tyou needn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about that,‚M-^@M-^] he said; ‚M-^@M-^\besides,$
+it‚M-^@M-^Yll be daylight in two hours, and a burglar wants that time to get$
+home.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy paused irresolutely. It seemed absurd to wait any longer, and$
+besides, to be consistent he must be prepared to adopt this watchman$
+r√¥le every night.$
+$
+There was no particular reason why Sir John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys enemy should choose$
+this night or any other. He had half expected to see Cartwright and was$
+agreeably disappointed that he did not loom into view.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre right,‚M-^@M-^] he said to the policeman. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll walk along down$
+the road with you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They must have walked a quarter of a mile, and were standing chatting at$
+the corner of the street, when a sound, borne clearly on the night air,$
+made both men look back in the direction whence they had come. They saw$
+two glaring spots of light somewhere in the vicinity of the Judge‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+house.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a car,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, ‚M-^@M-^\what is it doing there at this time$
+of the morning? There is nobody sick in the house, is there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head. Already he had begun to walk back, and the$
+policeman, sensing something wrong, kept him company. They had covered$
+half the distance which separated them from the car, when it began to$
+move toward them, gathering speed. It flashed past and Timothy saw$
+nothing save the driver, for the hood was raised and its canvas blinds$
+hid whatever passenger it carried.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It came in from the other end of the avenue,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman$
+unnecessarily. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe Sir John is going a long journey and is starting$
+early.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell would have told me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, troubled. ‚M-^@M-^\I nearly took$
+a chance and made a jump for that car.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was one of the few chances Timothy did not take, and one that he$
+bitterly regretted afterwards.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you had,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical policeman, ‚M-^@M-^\I should have been looking$
+for the ambulance for you now.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was no longer satisfied to play the r√¥le of the silent watcher.$
+When he came to the house he went boldly through the gate and up the$
+drive, and his warrant for the intrusion was the officer who followed$
+him. It was then that he saw the open window of the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys room, and his$
+heart leapt into his mouth. He quickened his step, but just as he came$
+under the window, she appeared, and Timothy sighed his relief.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is that you?‚M-^@M-^] she said in a low worried voice; ‚M-^@M-^\is that Mr. Anderson?$
+Thank heaven you‚M-^@M-^Yve come! Wait, I will come down and open the door for$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He walked to the entrance, and presently the door was opened and the$
+girl, dressed in a wrapper, appeared. She tried to keep her voice$
+steady, but the strain of the past half-hour had been too much for her,$
+and she was on the verge of tears when Timothy put his arm about her$
+shaking shoulders and forced her down into a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and tell us what has happened.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at the officer and tried to speak.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys a servant,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman; ‚M-^@M-^\perhaps he knows something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A man dressed in shirt and trousers was coming down the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can‚M-^@M-^Yt make him hear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\or Lady Maxell, either.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What has happened?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know, sir. The young lady woke me and asked me to rouse Sir$
+John.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wait, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sorry I am so silly. I am probably$
+making a lot of trouble over nothing. It happened nearly an hour ago, I$
+was asleep and I heard a sound; thought I was dreaming of what happened$
+last night. It sounded like two shots, but, whatever it was, it woke$
+me.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know. I thought I heard them too,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then you were out there all the time?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and put out her hand$
+to him.$
+$
+For that look she gave him Timothy would have stayed out the three$
+hundred and sixty-five nights in the year.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I lay for a very long time, thinking that the sound would wake my$
+uncle, but I heard nothing.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is your room near Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys?‚M-^@M-^] asked the policeman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, mine is on this side of the building; Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+sleep on the other side. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know what it was, but something alarmed$
+me and filled me with terror‚M-^@M-^Tsomething that made my flesh go rough and$
+cold‚M-^@M-^Toh, it was horrible!‚M-^@M-^] she shuddered.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt endure it any longer, so I got out of bed and went out into$
+the corridor to wake uncle. Just then I heard a sound outside my window,$
+but I was just too terrified to look out. Then I heard a motor-car and$
+footsteps on the path outside. I went to Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys door and knocked,$
+but got no answer. Then I tried Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys door, but there was no$
+answer there either. So I went to Johnson‚M-^@M-^Ys room and woke him;‚M-^@M-^] she$
+looked at Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^TI‚M-^@M-^Tthought that you might be there, so I came$
+back to the open window and looked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Show me Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the policeman to the servant, and the$
+three men passed up the stairs, followed by the girl.$
+$
+The door which the man indicated was locked, and even when the policeman$
+hammered on the panel there was no response.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think the key of my door will unlock almost any of the room doors,‚M-^@M-^]$
+said the girl suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John told me once that all the room locks$
+were made on the same plan.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She went away and came back with a key. The policeman fitted it in the$
+lock and opened the door, feeling for and finding the electric switch as$
+he entered. The room was empty, and apparently the bed had not been$
+occupied.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where does that door lead?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That leads to Lady Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys room,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl; ‚M-^@M-^\there is a key on$
+this side.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+This door he found was open and again they found an empty room and a bed$
+which had not been slept in. They looked at one another.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Sir John be in his study till late?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is at the end of the corridor,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a broken voice, for she$
+felt that the study held some dreadful secret.$
+$
+This door was locked too, locked from the inside. By now the policeman$
+was standing on no ceremony, and with a quick thrust of his shoulder he$
+broke the lock, and the door flew open.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let us have a little light,‚M-^@M-^] he said, unconsciously copying words which$
+had been spoken in that room an hour before.$
+$
+The room was empty, but here at any rate was evidence. The safe stood$
+open, the fireplace was filled with glowing ashes, and the air of the$
+room was pungent with the scent of burnt paper.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is this?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy, pointing to the ground.$
+$
+The floor of the study was covered with a thick, biscuit-coloured$
+carpet, and ‚M-^@M-^\this‚M-^@M-^] was a round, dark stain which was still wet. The$
+policeman went on his knees and examined it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is blood,‚M-^@M-^] he said briefly; ‚M-^@M-^\there‚M-^@M-^Ys another patch near the door.$
+Where does this door lead? Catch that girl, she‚M-^@M-^Ys fainting!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was just in time to slip his arm round Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys waist before she$
+collapsed. By this time the household was aroused, and a woman servant$
+was on the spot to take charge of Mary. When Timothy had rejoined the$
+policeman, that officer had discovered where the door led.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You go down a stairway into the garden,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It looks as if two$
+shots were fired here. Look, there‚M-^@M-^Ys the mark of both of them on the$
+wall.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you suggest that two people have been killed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The policeman nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\One was shot in the middle of the room, and one was probably shot on$
+the way to the door. What do you make of this?‚M-^@M-^] and he held up a bag,$
+discoloured and weather-worn, with a handle to which was fastened a long$
+length of rusty wire.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is empty,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer, examining the contents of the little$
+grip which, up till an hour before, had held John Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys most$
+jealously guarded secrets.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll use this ‚M-^@M-^Yphone,‚M-^@M-^] said the officer. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yd better stay by, Mr.$
+Anderson. We shall want your evidence‚M-^@M-^Tit will be important. It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+often we have a man watching outside a house where a murder is$
+committed‚M-^@M-^Tprobably two.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The sun had risen before the preliminary interrogation and the search of$
+the house and grounds had been concluded. Blewitt the detective, who had$
+taken charge of the case, came into the dining-room, where a worried$
+servant was serving coffee for the investigators, and dropped down on to$
+a chair.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue and there‚M-^@M-^Ys one clue alone,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and drew from$
+his pocket a soft hat. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you recognise this, Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that was worn last night by the man I spoke to you$
+about.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I could swear to it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Where did you find it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Outside,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective; ‚M-^@M-^\and that is all we have to go on. There$
+is no sign of any body. My first theory stands.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You believe that the murderer carried Sir John and Lady Maxell into the$
+car and drove away with them?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy; ‚M-^@M-^\but that pre-supposes that$
+the chauffeur was in the plot.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He may have been and he may have been terrorised,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Even a taxi-driver will be obliging if you stick a gun in his stomach.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt Miss Maxell have heard‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] began Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell heard,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\but was afraid to look out.$
+She also heard two shots. My theory is that Sir John and Lady Maxell$
+were killed, that the murderer first locked both the bedrooms, went$
+through Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys papers, presumably to discover something$
+incriminating himself, and to destroy such documents.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But why not leave the bodies?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because without the bodies no indictment of murder could hold against$
+him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy Anderson turned as the girl came in. She was looking very tired,$
+but she was calmer than she had been earlier in the morning.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is there any news?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, and Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have searched every inch of the ground,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated to ask the question.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am afraid,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy gently, ‚M-^@M-^\that there is very little hope.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But have you searched everywhere?‚M-^@M-^] insisted the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Everywhere,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+Soon after, Timothy took the girl away to an hotel for breakfast and to$
+arrange for a room, and the house was left in charge of the police.$
+Later came the famous detective Gilborne, who made an independent$
+search, but he, like his predecessors, failed to discover any further$
+evidence, because he also knew nothing of the disused well, which lay$
+hidden under a rubbish heap.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XV$
+$
+$
+WHO killed Sir John Maxell and his wife?$
+$
+Where had their bodies been hidden? These were the two questions which$
+were to agitate England for the traditional space of nine days. For one$
+day, at any rate, they formed the sole topic of speculation amongst the$
+intelligent section of fifty million people.$
+$
+The first question was easier to answer than the second. It was obvious$
+to the newsmen that the murderer was Cartwright, whose threats of$
+vengeance were recalled and whose appearance at Bournemouth had been$
+described at second-hand by the detective in charge of the case.$
+First-hand information was for the moment denied the pressmen, for$
+Timothy, fully dressed, lay on his bed in a sound sleep. Happily for$
+him, neither then nor later did any of the enterprising newspaper men$
+associate the ‚M-^@M-^\A. C.‚M-^@M-^] in his name with the wanted criminal. He was at$
+least spared that embarrassment.$
+$
+But the story of his vigil as ‚M-^@M-^\a friend of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys‚M-^@M-^] was in print long$
+before he woke up to find a small and impatient army of reporters$
+waiting to interview him. He answered the reporters‚M-^@M-^Y interrogations as$
+briefly as possible, bathed and changed and made his way to the hotel$
+where the girl was. She was leaving as he arrived, and the warmth of her$
+greeting almost banished the depression which lay upon him. She put her$
+arm through his so naturally that he did not realise his wonderful$
+fortune.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve got something to tell you,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\unless you know already.$
+All my money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped with a gasp.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt mean that?‚M-^@M-^] he said seriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is true,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe it was very little and my loss is$
+so insignificant compared with the other awful affair that I am not$
+worrying about it.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But Sir John had money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have just seen his lawyers,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\they have been to the bank$
+and there is not a hundred pounds to his credit, and that amount will be$
+absorbed by the cheques he has drawn. He drew a very, very large sum,$
+including my money, from the bank two days ago. You know,‚M-^@M-^] she went on,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that Sir John contemplated leaving for America? He had already$
+given me a hint, asking me how long it would take me to pack my$
+belongings, and I fancy that had something to do with the telegram he$
+received‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Announcing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys escape,‚M-^@M-^] nodded Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was so kind and so gentle,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, her eyes filling with$
+tears, ‚M-^@M-^\that to me he was more like a father. Oh, it is awful, awful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But you?‚M-^@M-^] asked the agitated Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do? Good$
+heavens! It is dreadful!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shall have to work,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl practically and with a little$
+smile. ‚M-^@M-^\I do not think that will kill me. Hundreds of thousands of girls$
+have to work for their living, Timothy, and I shall have to work for$
+mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy drew a long breath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not if I can help it, you won‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I am sure I shall make a$
+lot of money. I can feel it in my bones. If a man takes a job‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You mustn‚M-^@M-^Yt talk like that,‚M-^@M-^] she said, pressing his arm, ‚M-^@M-^\and anyway,$
+how could I let you help me or keep me? That sort of thing isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+done‚M-^@M-^Tnot by nice girls.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She laughed, but became sober again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you know that Sir John was very much interested in you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In me?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+She nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I told you so the other day. I think he liked you, because he was$
+saying how uncomfortable you must be at Vermont House, living in that$
+queer little room of yours.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy was startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did he know I was living at Vermont House?‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+She smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Vermont House happens to be Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys property,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\In fact, I$
+think it is the only realisable piece of property he has, now that the$
+money has gone.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What shall you do immediately?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know,‚M-^@M-^] she replied. ‚M-^@M-^\I think the first step is to get out of$
+this hotel, which is much too expensive for me. I have a few pounds in$
+the bank, but that won‚M-^@M-^Yt last very long.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At his earnest entreaty she agreed to see a solicitor and appoint him to$
+save whatever was possible from the wreckage of Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys estate. Two$
+hours passed like as many minutes, until Timothy remembered that he had$
+an appointment with a London reporter‚M-^@M-^Tone Brennan. Brennan he had known$
+in his cinema days, and Timothy literally fell upon his neck.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve nothing to tell the boys that hasn‚M-^@M-^Yt already been told,‚M-^@M-^] he said,$
+putting down the newspaper which Brennan handed to him. ‚M-^@M-^\I am as anxious$
+for news as you are. Have there been any developments?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter, ‚M-^@M-^\except that Sir John had no money at the$
+bank and no money could be found in the house.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That I know,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all his securities were drawn out two days ago.$
+That was the stuff that Cartwright was after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does Miss Maxell know‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] Brennan began.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She does know and she took it like a brick.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was about twenty thousand pounds,‚M-^@M-^] Brennan went on. ‚M-^@M-^\The only other$
+clue the police have is that the safe was opened by Maxell‚M-^@M-^Ys duplicate$
+key. The old man had two sets made, one of which he used to keep in his$
+combination safe in his bedroom and the other he carried around with$
+him. Miss Maxell told a story that the night before the murder Lady$
+Maxell asked her to secure possession of the keys in order to open a$
+bureau.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I see. Is it suggested that Lady Maxell detached the key of the safe$
+and that it was she who opened it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one theory,‚M-^@M-^] said the other, ‚M-^@M-^\the police have miles of ‚M-^@M-^Yem!$
+They‚M-^@M-^Yve got everything except the bodies and the murderer. Now come out$
+with that story, Anderson! You must know a great deal more than you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+told, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym simply without a new fact that these evening papers$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt got, to hang my story on. Why did Cartwright come to your room,$
+anyway? Do you know him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He was an acquaintance of my father‚M-^@M-^Ys,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically,$
+‚M-^@M-^\and perhaps he thought I knew Maxell better than I did.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That sounds pretty thin,‚M-^@M-^] said the reporter. ‚M-^@M-^\Why should he come to$
+you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose I am the only person he knew or knew about,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+patiently. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose he‚M-^@M-^Yd been all round Bournemouth trying to find a$
+familiar name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] admitted the reporter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I was a kid when he went to gaol. You don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+imagine I knew him at all, do you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had gone out to meet the girl, forgetting to take his watch, and now$
+he was looking round for it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here is a theory,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan suddenly. ‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Lady Maxell isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+dead at all.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you mean?‚M-^@M-^] asked the other.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Suppose Cartwright killed Maxell and Lady Maxell witnessed the murder.$
+Suppose this fellow had to decide whether he would kill the witness or$
+whether he would go away with her? You said the motor-car which came to$
+the house in the middle of the night was the same as that in which Lady$
+Maxell came home. Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely that she should have told the$
+murderer, for some reason or other, that the car was coming, because$
+evidently she had arranged for it to come, and that they went away$
+together? Isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it likely, too, that she was in the plot, and that, so$
+far from being a victim, she was one of the criminals? We know her$
+antecedents. There was some trouble over her stabbing a young American,$
+Reggie van Rhyn. In fact, most of the evidence seems to incriminate her.$
+There is the key, for example. Who else but she could have taken the$
+duplicate key? Doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt it look as though she planned the whole thing,$
+and that her accomplice came in at the last moment to help her get away$
+and possibly to settle Sir John?$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take the incident of the two locked bedrooms. Obviously somebody who$
+lived in the house and who knew the family routine must have done that.$
+Both Sir John and Lady Maxell were in the habit of fastening their doors$
+at night, and the servants did not go into the bedrooms unless they were$
+rung for. It seems to me fairly clear that Lady Maxell locked the doors$
+so that the suspicions of the servants should not be aroused in the$
+morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If I had your powers of deduction,‚M-^@M-^] said the admiring Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+should never miss a winner. Where the blazes is my watch?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Try under the pillow,‚M-^@M-^] said Brennan.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I never put it there,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy, but nevertheless turned the$
+pillow over and stood gaping.$
+$
+For beneath the pillow was a long, stout envelope with a tell-tale blood$
+stain in one corner.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For heaven‚M-^@M-^Ys sake!‚M-^@M-^] breathed Timothy, and took up the package.$
+$
+It bore no address and was sealed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What on earth is this?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I can tell you what those stains are,‚M-^@M-^] said the practical Brennan. ‚M-^@M-^\Is$
+there any name on it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Open it,‚M-^@M-^] suggested the reporter, and the other obeyed.$
+$
+The contents were even more astonishing, for they consisted of a thick$
+pad of money. They were new Bank of England notes and were bound about$
+by a tight band of paper. On the band was written in Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+handwriting:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Proceeds of the sale of stocks held in trust for Miss Mary$
+    Maxell. ¬£21,300.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+                 *        *        *        *        *$
+$
+The detective in charge of the case was a man of many theories. But his$
+new theory was an uncomfortable one for Timothy Anderson.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This puts a new light upon the case,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+being perfectly frank with you, Mr. Anderson, that the new light isn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+very favourable to you. Here you are, outside the building when the$
+crime is committed. You are seen by a policeman a few minutes after the$
+shots are fired, and a portion of the money stolen from the house is$
+discovered under your pillow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Discovered by me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\in the presence of a witness. And are$
+you suggesting that, whilst I was with your policeman, I was also$
+driving the car, or that I was wearing Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys cap which was found$
+in the grounds? Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve the finger-print of your man and you‚M-^@M-^Yre$
+at liberty to compare it with mine.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a finger-print anyway,‚M-^@M-^] said the detective, ‚M-^@M-^\it is the print$
+of a knuckle and we do not keep a record of knuckles. No, I admit that$
+the motor-car conflicts a little bit with my theory. Have you any$
+suggestion to offer?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The only suggestion I can make,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\is that Cartwright, in a$
+hurry to get away and knowing the position of my room, hid the money$
+there for fear he should be caught with the goods. At any rate, if I$
+were the criminal I would not hide a bloodstained envelope under my$
+pillow. I should at least have the intelligence to burn the envelope and$
+put the money where the servants of this house could not find it. Why,$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt you see,‚M-^@M-^] he said vigorously, ‚M-^@M-^\that any of the servants at this$
+boarding-house would have found the envelope if I hadn‚M-^@M-^Yt?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The detective scratched his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There‚M-^@M-^Ys something in that,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\It is a very queer case.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And it is being investigated by very queer people,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy$
+irritably.$
+$
+A little further investigation, however, relieved Timothy of all$
+suspicion. He had not returned to the house until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock that$
+morning. The maid, who had taken him a cup of tea at eight, noticing$
+that he had been out all night, thought it was an excellent opportunity$
+to straighten the room to ‚M-^@M-^\get it off her mind,‚M-^@M-^] as she said. She did$
+not remake the bed, but had tidied it. Whilst sweeping she had seen the$
+envelope lying on the floor near the open window and had picked it up$
+and, for want of a better place, thinking ‚M-^@M-^\it was private‚M-^@M-^] had slipped$
+it under Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys pillow.$
+$
+As Timothy had not been out of sight of the police since the tragedy$
+until his return to his lodgings, there could be no suggestion that he$
+had any part in hiding the envelope. Whatever irritation he felt was$
+dispelled by his large and generous satisfaction when the poverty which$
+threatened Mary was averted. But why should Cartwright hide the money$
+there? Why should he stop in his headlong flight to come to the window,$
+as evidently he did, and throw the package into the room? There were a$
+hundred places where he might have left it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That cousin stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt work,‚M-^@M-^] thought Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and if you think$
+he‚M-^@M-^Ys going to rely upon his relationship with me and can use me to look$
+after his money, he‚M-^@M-^Ys made one large mistake.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw the girl again at the official inquiry, and met her on the day$
+after. She was going to Bath where she had some distant relations, and$
+they had met to say good-bye.$
+$
+It was a gloomy occasion‚M-^@M-^Tless gloomy for Timothy than for the girl,$
+because he was already planning a move to the town in which she was$
+taking up her quarters. This cheerful view was banished, however, when$
+she explained that her stay in Bath was merely a temporary expedient.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew has wired asking me to come‚M-^@M-^Tand it seems as good a place$
+as any for a few months. I don‚M-^@M-^Yt think I shall stay here any longer,‚M-^@M-^]$
+she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want a change of air and a change of scene. Timothy, I feel$
+that I shall never get over Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Never is a very long time, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently, and she could$
+only wonder at the tender kindness in his voice.$
+$
+She had little time to wonder, however, for she had a proposition to$
+make to him and she hardly knew how to reduce it to words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Are you‚M-^@M-^Tare you‚M-^@M-^Tworking?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys broad smile answered her plainly that he was not.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The fact is,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt quite decided what I am going$
+to do. If you were going down to Bath for good, I was going down to Bath$
+also. Maybe I could start a druggist‚M-^@M-^Ys or buy a store, or run errands$
+for somebody. I am the most accommodating worker.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she began and stopped.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well?‚M-^@M-^] he repeated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I had an idea that maybe you would like to go on and conduct an$
+independent search‚M-^@M-^Tindependent of the police, I mean‚M-^@M-^Tand find$
+something about the man who killed Sir John, and perhaps bring him to$
+justice. You know, I think you are clever enough,‚M-^@M-^] she went on$
+hurriedly, ‚M-^@M-^\and it would be work after your own heart.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was looking at her steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Quite right, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly, ‚M-^@M-^\but that involves spending a$
+whole lot of money. What misguided person do you suggest would send me$
+out on that kind of job?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I thought‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] She hesitated, and then a little incoherently,$
+‚M-^@M-^\You see, I have the money‚M-^@M-^Tmainly through you‚M-^@M-^Tmy own money, I mean. I$
+feel I have a duty to my poor uncle and I could trust you to do your$
+very best. I could afford it, Timothy‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tshe laid her hand on his arm and$
+looked up at him almost beseechingly‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\indeed I can afford it. I have$
+more money than I shall ever spend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He patted her hand softly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is just the kind of job I should like, and with$
+anybody‚M-^@M-^Ys money but yours, why, I‚M-^@M-^Yd be out of the country in two shakes,$
+looking for Mr. Cartwright in the most expensive cities of the world.$
+But, my dear, I cannot accept your commission, because I know just what$
+lies behind it. You think I‚M-^@M-^Ym a restless, rather shiftless sort of$
+fellow, and you want to give me a good time‚M-^@M-^Twith your money.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He stopped and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, my dear,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\thank you, but, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was disappointed and for a moment a little hurt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Would two hundred pounds‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] she suggested timidly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not your two hundred,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\That lawyer of yours should take$
+better care of your money, Mary. He shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt allow you to make these$
+tempting offers to young men,‚M-^@M-^] he was smiling now. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you go abroad?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Perhaps‚M-^@M-^Tsome day,‚M-^@M-^] she said vaguely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John wanted me to go‚M-^@M-^Tand I$
+feel that I should be pleasing him. Some day, yes, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Maybe I‚M-^@M-^Yll go over at the same time as you,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I thought of$
+taking a chance in Paris for a while‚M-^@M-^Tyou can make big money in Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In‚M-^@M-^Ta while?‚M-^@M-^] she smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\In a minute,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy grimly, ‚M-^@M-^\if the horse and the jockey are of$
+the same way of thinking. I know a fellow who races pretty extensively$
+in France. He has a horse called Flirt‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She held out her hand for the second time.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, you‚M-^@M-^Yre incorrigible,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+She did not see him again for twelve months, not indeed until, after a$
+winter spent in Madeira, she put her foot over the gangway of the s.s.$
+_Tigilanes_ and met the quizzical smile of the youth who was waiting to$
+receive her.$
+$
+For Timothy had been in Funchal a month, seeing but unseen, since Mary$
+was generally in bed before the Casino woke up and play reached any$
+exciting level.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVI$
+$
+$
+TIMOTHY sat now on an upturned trunk, his elbows on the rails of the$
+s.s. _Tigilanes_ and his speculative eye roving the river front of$
+Liverpool.$
+$
+It was the last hour of the voyage, and Timothy, who had left Funchal$
+with four hundred pounds in his pocket-book, had exactly three genuine$
+shillings and a five-milreis piece of dubious quality.$
+$
+A man strolled along the deck and fell in at his side.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cleaned you out last night, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt they?‚M-^@M-^] he asked sympathetically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh? Oh, yes, I believe they did. That red-haired man had all the luck$
+and most of the cards.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He smiled and Timothy had a swift, happy smile that brought tired little$
+ridges under his eyes. He was not only good-looking and young, but he$
+was interesting.$
+$
+The man at his side took the cigar from his teeth and looked at it$
+before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, you know they were crooks‚M-^@M-^Tthey work this coast line$
+regularly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Eh?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked round, shocked and pained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You don‚M-^@M-^Yt say? Crooks! What, that little red-haired fellow who has been$
+trying to pick a quarrel with me all the voyage, and the tall,$
+nice-looking Englishman?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His companion nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember the Captain warned us not to play cards‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They always do that to be on the safe side,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, but he was$
+obviously uneasy. ‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I knew they were crooks‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Knew! Good lord! Anybody will tell you. Ask the purser. Anyway, you‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+been stung and you can do nothing. The best thing to do is to grin and$
+bear your losses. It is experience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy felt the three honest shillings in his pocket and whistled$
+dismally.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of course, if I were sure‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned abruptly away and raced down the main companion-way to the$
+purser‚M-^@M-^Ys little office under the stairs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Macleod, I want to see you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, sir,‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^Tall pursers are a little suspicious,‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^\anything wrong with$
+your bill?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No‚M-^@M-^Tnot unless his name‚M-^@M-^Ys Bill. Shall I come in?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser opened the half-door and admitted him to the sanctuary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are two fellows aboard this packet‚M-^@M-^Ta red-haired fellow named$
+Chelwyn and a disguised duke named Brown‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you know about ‚M-^@M-^Yem?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The purser made a face. It was intended to convey his lack of real$
+interest in either.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll put it plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said the patient Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Are they crooks?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They play cards,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser diplomatically.$
+$
+He desired at this the eleventh hour to avoid scandal, explanations, and$
+such other phenomena which he associated in his mind with the$
+confrontation of the wise men and their dupes. That sort of thing$
+brought the Line into disrepute, and indirectly reflected upon the$
+ship‚M-^@M-^Ys officers. Besides, the ship was making port, and, like all$
+pursers, he was up to his eyes in work and frantically anxious to clear$
+it off in a minimum time so that he could take a train to his little$
+villa at Lytham, where his family was established.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mr. Anderson, if you‚M-^@M-^Yve been stung,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but the$
+captain gives fair warning the first night out of Cape Town and$
+Madeira‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys where you came aboard, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^Tand there were notices$
+posted up, both in the saloon and in the smoking-room. Have you lost$
+much?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He looked up with some sympathy at the tall, athletic figure with the$
+tired, smiling eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I cleared up ¬£500 at the Funchal Casino,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I reckon I$
+have spent ¬£100 legitimately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The rest is gone, eh?‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\Well, Mr. Anderson, I am$
+afraid I can do nothing. The best thing to do is to mark it down against$
+‚M-^@M-^XExperience‚M-^@M-^Y.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll forgive you for being philosophical about my losses,‚M-^@M-^] said$
+Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Will you be kind enough to tell me the number of Mr. Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+cabin?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Two seventy-four,‚M-^@M-^] said the purser. ‚M-^@M-^\I say, Mr. Anderson, if I were you$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yd let the matter drop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you would, dear old thing,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, shaking him warmly by$
+the hand, ‚M-^@M-^\and if I were you I should let it drop too. But, as I am$
+me‚M-^@M-^T274, I think you said?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope you‚M-^@M-^Yre not going to make any trouble, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] said the$
+alarmed purser. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve done our best to make you comfortable on the$
+voyage.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And I did my best to pay for my ticket, so we‚M-^@M-^Yre quits,‚M-^@M-^] and with a$
+wave of his hand Timothy strode out of the cabin, dodged down past the$
+steward carrying up the luggage to the next deck, and walked swiftly$
+along the carpeted corridor till he found a little number-plate bearing$
+the figures ‚M-^@M-^\274.‚M-^@M-^] He knocked at the cabin door, and gruff voice said,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come in!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Chelwyn, the red-haired man, was in his shirt sleeves, fastening his$
+collar. Brown was sitting on the edge of his bunk, smoking a cigarette,$
+and Chelwyn, who had seen Timothy reflected in the mirror as he came in,$
+was first to recognise him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hullo, Mr. Anderson, do you want anything?‚M-^@M-^] he asked politely. ‚M-^@M-^\Sorry$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yve had such bad luck‚M-^@M-^Twhat the devil are you doing?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy had shut the door and slipped the bolt.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I want something,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You want‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Listen. I thought you were playing straight, you fellows, or I wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+have played with you. I‚M-^@M-^Ym willing to take a chance, for that‚M-^@M-^Ys my motto$
+in life, dear lads, but there isn‚M-^@M-^Yt a chance to take when you‚M-^@M-^Yre playing$
+with crooks.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here,‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man, walking over to him and$
+emphasising his words with his forefinger against Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys chest, ‚M-^@M-^\that$
+kind of stuff doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt amuse me. If you lose your money, lose it like a$
+sportsman and a gentleman, and don‚M-^@M-^Yt squeal.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy grinned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Boys,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds from you, so step lively.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The suave Mr. Brown, who had been watching the scene with bored eyes,$
+stroking his drooping moustache the while, made a gentle entrance into$
+the conversation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym rather surprised, in fact, I am shocked, Mr. Anderson, that you$
+should take this line,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve lost your money fairly and$
+squarely‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys where you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy pleasantly. ‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym telling$
+you this. We‚M-^@M-^Yre very near the shore. Somewhere at the back of those$
+warehouses there‚M-^@M-^Ys certain to be a police organisation and a well-paid$
+magistrate. You are going to have a grand opportunity of appearing in$
+the respectable part of the court as a prosecutor, for I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to beat$
+you up‚M-^@M-^Tfirst you,‚M-^@M-^] he pointed to the red-haired Chelwyn, ‚M-^@M-^\and then$
+you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre going to beat me up, are you?‚M-^@M-^] said the red-haired man and made$
+a quick dive.$
+$
+It was not pretty to watch, unless you took an interest in fighting.$
+They closed for a second and something jolted twice under Chelwyn‚M-^@M-^Ys jaw.$
+He fell back against the cabin partition. He leapt again, but Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+fist met him half-way, and he never really felt what hit him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve won this fight,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I award myself a purse of four$
+hundred pounds. Do you take any interest in these proceedings. Brown?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The other man had not moved from his bunk, but now he rose and lifted$
+his dazed companion to his feet.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yd better pay this fellow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll see him‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] mumbled the other, but Brown was apparently the$
+brains of the organisation and had merely mentioned his intention of$
+paying out of sheer politeness to his companion.$
+$
+He took a thick pocket-book from his hip pocket and counted out the$
+notes, and Timothy picked them up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll fix you for this,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn, mopping his bleeding lip. ‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve$
+taken this from me‚M-^@M-^Tnot him.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy as he unbolted the door and stepped$
+out.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Some day I‚M-^@M-^Yll get you,‚M-^@M-^] said the livid man, and the finger he pointed$
+at Timothy was shaking with anger.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance on that,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He ascended the companion-way feeling remarkably cheerful, and met the$
+purser coming down. That officer regarded him even more suspiciously$
+than ever. But as there were no signs of the fray upon him, the purser$
+went to his cabin relieved, and Timothy passed out to relieve his$
+feelings by the side of the rail. So he sat whilst the big liner was$
+brought alongside the wharf, and then he heard his name spoken and$
+jumped up, hat in hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I just wanted to tell you, Timothy, in case I did not see you on the$
+train,‚M-^@M-^] she remarked, ‚M-^@M-^\that Mrs. Renfrew has decided not to go back to$
+Bath but to go on to Paris almost immediately.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good for Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Bath or Paris will find me$
+hanging around. I nearly came down to you just now to borrow my fare to$
+Bath.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice, ‚M-^@M-^\did you lose all the money you$
+won in Funchal?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy rubbed his nose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt exactly lose it,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I lent it and it has just been$
+repaid.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt think it proper your travelling on the same boat.$
+She thinks you ought not to have come to Madeira after me‚M-^@M-^Tus.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was mischief in Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes, in spite of the solemnity of her$
+tone.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I shouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt worry about what Mrs. Renfrew thinks,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Why,$
+you‚M-^@M-^Yre almost as badly off for cousins as I am.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\As you are?‚M-^@M-^] she said in surprise. ‚M-^@M-^\Have you any cousins?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hundreds of ‚M-^@M-^Yem,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy glibly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who are they?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, interested.$
+$
+She had reached a stage in their friendship when his relatives were$
+immensely interesting.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt know their names,‚M-^@M-^] lied Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt give ‚M-^@M-^Yem names but$
+numbers‚M-^@M-^Tone, two, three, four, etc.‚M-^@M-^Tjust at that moment I was thinking$
+of number seventy-nine‚M-^@M-^Tgood morning, Mrs. Renfrew.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew was severe and thin, with a yellow face and hooked nose.$
+She was a member of one of the best, if not the best, families in Bath,$
+and it was an unfailing source of pride that she did not know the people$
+that other people knew.$
+$
+Mary watched the encounter with dancing eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I have the pleasure of your company to London?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mrs.$
+Renfrew.$
+$
+She invariably made a point of leaving Mary out, and indeed sustained$
+the pleasant fiction that Mary had no existence on board the ship.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The pleasure will be mine,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I am not travelling with you$
+to London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He said this so innocently that Mrs. Renfrew was in the middle of her$
+next observation before she had any idea that the remark had an$
+offensive interpretation.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You seem to have had a very unfortunate experience‚M-^@M-^Twhat do you mean?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Happily a very hot-looking steward made his appearance at that moment$
+and called Mrs. Renfrew away. She gathered up her charge and with a$
+withering glance at Timothy departed.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Take A Chance‚M-^@M-^] Anderson, feeling particularly happy, was one of the$
+first to land and strolled along the quay-side waiting within view of$
+the gangway for Mary to disembark. Immediately above him towered the$
+high decks of the _Tigilanes_‚M-^@M-^Ta fact of which he was reminded when,$
+with a crash, a heavy wooden bucket dropped so close to his head that it$
+grazed his shoulder. It was a large bucket, and, dropped from that$
+height, might have caused him considerable physical distress.$
+$
+He looked up.$
+$
+The two card-players with whom he had had some argument were lolling$
+over the rail, their faces turned in quite another direction and talking$
+earnestly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Hi!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+They were deaf, it appeared, for they still continued their discussion.$
+A deck hand was passing with a crate load of oranges; one fell out and$
+Timothy picked it up. The attention of Messrs. Chelwyn and Brown was$
+still directed elsewhere, and with a little swing of his arm Timothy$
+sent the orange upon its swift and unerring course. It caught the$
+red-haired man square in the side of the face and burst, and he jumped$
+round with an oath.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve dropped your bucket,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sweetly. ‚M-^@M-^\Shall I throw it at$
+you or will you come down and get it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man said something violent, but his companion pulled him away, and$
+Timothy went to look for a seat with peace in his heart.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XVII$
+$
+$
+THE train was crowded, but he secured a corner seat in one of the$
+cell-like compartments. It was empty when he entered, but immediately$
+after, to his surprise, Brown and Chelwyn followed him in and deposited$
+their goods upon three seats that they might in the manner of all$
+experienced travellers, occupy breathing space for three at the cost of$
+two tickets.$
+$
+They took no notice of Timothy until the train drew out and he wondered$
+what their game was. It was hardly likely that they would start any$
+rough work with him after their experience of the morning and less$
+likely because these boat trains were well policed.$
+$
+Clear of the Riverside Station the smooth Englishman leant forward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I hope, Mr. Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\that you will forget and forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Surely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I have nothing to forgive.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My friend,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown with a smile, ‚M-^@M-^\is very precipitate‚M-^@M-^Twhich$
+means hasty,‚M-^@M-^] he explained.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I thought it meant crooked.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+A spasm contorted the features of Mr. Chelwyn, but he said nothing. As$
+for Brown, he laughed. He laughed heartily but spuriously.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys not a bad joke,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but to tell you the truth, we mistook$
+you for‚M-^@M-^Tone of us, and my friend and I thought it would be a good joke$
+to get the better of you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And was it?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was and it wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown, not easily nonplussed. ‚M-^@M-^\Of$
+course, we intended restoring the money to you before you left the$
+ship.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Naturally,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I never thought you would do anything else.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Only you know you rather spoilt our little _esprit_.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If the conversation is to develop in a foreign language,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy,$
+‚M-^@M-^\I would only remark: _Honi soit qui mal y pense_,‚M-^@M-^] and the polite Mr.$
+Brown laughed again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You do not mind if my friend and I have a little quiet game by$
+ourselves, if,‚M-^@M-^] he said humorously, ‚M-^@M-^\we swindle one another.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I have no objection to watching, but if,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said cheerfully, ‚M-^@M-^\you should suddenly draw my attention whilst your$
+friend‚M-^@M-^Ys head is turned, to the ease with which I could win a hundred$
+pounds by picking the lady, or discovering the little pea under the$
+little shell, or show me a way of getting rich from any of the other$
+devices which the children of the public schools find so alluring at the$
+country fair, I shall be under the painful necessity of slapping you$
+violently on the wrist.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Thereafter the conversation languished until the train had run through$
+Crewe and was approaching Rugby. It was here that Mr. Brown stopped in$
+the midst of a long, learned discussion on English politics to offer his$
+cigarette-case to Timothy. Timothy chose a cigarette and put it in his$
+pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is one of the best Egyptian brands made,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown casually.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Best for you or best for me?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Bah!‚M-^@M-^] It was the red-haired Chelwyn who addressed him for the first$
+time. ‚M-^@M-^\What have you to be afraid of? You‚M-^@M-^Yre as scared as a cat! Do you$
+think we want to poison you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mr. Brown produced a flask and poured a modicum of whisky into the cup$
+and handed it to his companion, then he drank himself. Then, without$
+invitation he poured a little more into the cup and offered it to$
+Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let bygones be bygones,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no desire to be a bygone,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\I would much rather be$
+a herenow.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Nevertheless, he took the cup and smelt it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Butyl chloride,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\has a distinctive odour. I suppose you don‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+call it by its technical name, and to you it is just vulgarly ‚M-^@M-^Xa$
+knock-out drop.‚M-^@M-^Y Really,‚M-^@M-^] he said, handing back the cup, ‚M-^@M-^\you boys are$
+so elementary. Where did you learn it all‚M-^@M-^Tfrom the movies?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The red-haired man half rose from his seat with a growl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Sit down,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply, and with a jerk of his hand he flung$
+open the carriage door.$
+$
+The men shrank back at the sight of the rapidly running line, and at the$
+certainty of death which awaited any who left the train on that side of$
+the carriage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Start something,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I‚M-^@M-^Yll undertake to put either one$
+or both of you on to the line. We‚M-^@M-^Yre going at about sixty miles an hour,$
+and a fellow that went out there wouldn‚M-^@M-^Yt be taking a chance. Now is$
+there going to be a rough house?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Close the door, close the door,‚M-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown nervously. ‚M-^@M-^\What a$
+stupid idea, Mr. Anderson!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy swung the door to and the man moved up towards him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, I‚M-^@M-^Ym just going to put it to you plainly,‚M-^@M-^] said Brown. ‚M-^@M-^\We‚M-^@M-^Yve made$
+the voyage out to the Cape and the voyage back and the only mug we met$
+was you. What we won from you just about paid our expenses, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+putting it to you, as a sportsman and a gentleman, that you should let$
+us have half of that stuff back.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The sportsman in me admires your nerve,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but I suppose$
+it is the gentleman part that returns an indignant ‚M-^@M-^XNo!‚M-^@M-^Y to your$
+interesting observation.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Brown turned to his companion.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, that‚M-^@M-^Ys that, Len,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yll just have to let the money$
+go. It is a pity,‚M-^@M-^] he said wistfully and his companion grunted.$
+$
+That ended the conversation so far as the journey was concerned, and$
+Timothy heard no more until he was in the gloomy courtyard at Euston$
+Station and stepping into his taxi.$
+$
+To his surprise it was the red-haired man who approached him, and$
+something in his manner prevented Timothy from taking the action which$
+he otherwise would have thought necessary.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Look here, young fellow,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\you watch Brown‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys wild.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not exactly tame,‚M-^@M-^] smiled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt take any notice of me,‚M-^@M-^] said the man a little bitterly. ‚M-^@M-^\I am$
+engaged in the rough work. I should have got two hundred out of your$
+money‚M-^@M-^Tthat‚M-^@M-^Ys what made me so wild. Brown paid all my expenses and gives$
+me ten pound a week and a commission. It sounds funny to you, doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+it, but it is the truth,‚M-^@M-^] and somehow Timothy knew that the man was not$
+lying.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He‚M-^@M-^Ys finished with me‚M-^@M-^Tsays I am a hoodoo,‚M-^@M-^] said the little man. ‚M-^@M-^\Do$
+you know what I‚M-^@M-^Yve got out of five weeks‚M-^@M-^Y work? Look!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He held out his hand and disclosed two ten-pound notes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys dangerous,‚M-^@M-^] he warned Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you make any mistake$
+about that. I was only wild because I was losing my money, but he‚M-^@M-^Ys wild$
+because you‚M-^@M-^Yve got fresh with him and caught him out every time. Good$
+night!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here, wait,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He felt in his pocket.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If you‚M-^@M-^Yre lying, it is a plausible lie and one that pleases me,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said. ‚M-^@M-^\This will salve my conscience.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He slipped two notes into the man‚M-^@M-^Ys hands.$
+$
+Chelwyn was speechless for a moment. Then he asked:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And where are you staying in London, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel,‚M-^@M-^] repeated the other, ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll remember that. I$
+shall hear if anything is going on and I‚M-^@M-^Yll ‚M-^@M-^Yphone you. You‚M-^@M-^Yre a$
+gentleman, Mr. Anderson.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\So Mr. Brown said,‚M-^@M-^] remarked Timothy and drove off, feeling unusually$
+cheerful.$
+$
+If Timothy could be cheerful under the depressing conditions which$
+prevailed on the night of his arrival in London, he was a veritable$
+pattern of cheer. A drizzling rain was falling as the taxi squeaked its$
+way through a labyrinth of mean streets. He had glimpses of$
+wretched-looking people, grotesque of shape and unreal, through the$
+rain-blurred window of the cab.$
+$
+Then suddenly the character of the streets changed, and he was in a$
+broad street twinkling with light. There was a glimpse of trees, wide$
+open spaces, dotted with light. The street grew busier and the traffic$
+thicker, then suddenly the cab turned again into semi-darkness and$
+pulled up before the hotel.$
+$
+A porter opened the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do I think of Madeira?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy of the astonished man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had time to think. Will I be staying long in London? No. What$
+are my opinions of the political crisis which has arisen in my absence?$
+I would rather not say.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It takes a great deal to upset the equilibrium of a well-conducted hall$
+man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Have you booked your room?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+Timothy meekly admitted that he had.$
+$
+He woke to a London much more beautiful, to a vista of old-world$
+buildings such as Cruikshank loved to draw, to a green square and$
+glimpses of greener trees.$
+$
+Mary was staying at the Carlton, but he had arranged to meet her for$
+lunch. He had not arranged to meet her dragon, but he knew she would be$
+there. He had breakfasted, and was on the point of leaving the hotel,$
+when Chelwyn came.$
+$
+To say that Timothy regretted his generosity of the night before would$
+be to do him an injustice. Nevertheless, he had some misgivings as to$
+whether he had not been a little too generous. The appearance of Mr.$
+Chelwyn, early in the morning, looking so spruce and confident, was in$
+itself a suspicious happening, though events proved that the suspicion$
+was unfounded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Can I see you alone for a moment, Mr. Anderson?‚M-^@M-^] asked the red-haired$
+man.$
+$
+Timothy hesitated.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Come along to the drawing-room,‚M-^@M-^] he said.$
+$
+It was the one public room which would be empty at that time of the$
+morning. Mr. Chelwyn deposited his hat and stick and brand-new yellow$
+gloves before he spoke.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Mr. Anderson, I‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell you a few facts which will$
+surprise you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You haven‚M-^@M-^Yt had a gold brick sent to you by your Uncle George in$
+Alaska, have you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy dubiously. ‚M-^@M-^\Because I‚M-^@M-^Ym not buying that$
+kind of fact.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man smiled and shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is hardly likely I should try that stuff on you, sir,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\No,$
+this is a much more serious matter. Before I go any farther I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell$
+you that I am not asking for money. I am grateful to you for what you$
+did to me last night, Mr. Anderson. A crook has a wife and children the$
+same as anybody else. I have been in this funny business for ten years,$
+but now I‚M-^@M-^Ym out of it for good.‚M-^@M-^] He looked round and dropped his voice,$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson, I told you last night that we‚M-^@M-^Yve been five or six weeks$
+away from England. Didn‚M-^@M-^Yt that sound strange to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not to me,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That is because you don‚M-^@M-^Yt know the game,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\As a rule,$
+when we‚M-^@M-^Yre working these liners, we go out to Cape Town and come back by$
+the next ship that sails. What do you think we stayed at Funchal$
+for‚M-^@M-^Tthere‚M-^@M-^Ys no money in short voyages‚M-^@M-^Tit‚M-^@M-^Ys all on the long run from$
+Madeira to Cape Town.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt the slightest idea,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy wearily. ‚M-^@M-^\I don‚M-^@M-^Yt even$
+remember seeing you in Funchal‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We laid low,‚M-^@M-^] interrupted the man.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That may be, but if you‚M-^@M-^Yve come to tell me the interesting story of$
+your life, Ginger, I beg that you will cut it short‚M-^@M-^Tthe history, I$
+mean, not necessarily your life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Yll tell it to you as quickly as possible,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+don‚M-^@M-^Yt always work with Brown. In fact, I‚M-^@M-^Yve only worked with him about$
+three times before. I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man with the broads‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The broads?‚M-^@M-^] said the puzzled Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\With the cards,‚M-^@M-^] corrected the man. ‚M-^@M-^\I say that I‚M-^@M-^Ym not as good a man$
+with the broads as some of the others. I‚M-^@M-^Yve got a bit of a reputation$
+for scrapping. I‚M-^@M-^Yve never left a pal in the lurch and I‚M-^@M-^Yve always been$
+ready for any ‚M-^@M-^Xrough house‚M-^@M-^Y that came along. About two months ago Brown$
+sent for me‚M-^@M-^The‚M-^@M-^Ys got a flat off Piccadilly and lives like a lord. He$
+told me he was going to Madeira on a special job, that he‚M-^@M-^Yd been$
+employed by a lady in Paris‚M-^@M-^Ta Madame Serpilot (you‚M-^@M-^Yd better write that$
+down in your pocket-book)‚M-^@M-^Tto shepherd a young lady who was coming over.$
+Mind you, there was no harm intended to the young lady, but the general$
+idea was that she might be accompanied by a man, and he was the fellow$
+who had to be looked after.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What was the lady‚M-^@M-^Ys name?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said the man without hesitation, ‚M-^@M-^\and you were the fellow$
+we were asked to put out of business. Brown‚M-^@M-^Ys idea was to break you;$
+then, when you got to London, one of his pals would have met you and$
+offered to lend you money. They‚M-^@M-^Yd have framed up a charge against you of$
+obtaining money by false pretences, and you would have been pinched.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys eyebrows rose.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Was this Mrs. Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys plan?‚M-^@M-^] he asked, but the man shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, sir, she gave just the details to Brown. She never said what was to$
+be done to you, according to him, but you were to be stopped going$
+around with the young lady.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There you‚M-^@M-^Yve got me,‚M-^@M-^] said Chelwyn. ‚M-^@M-^\I believe she‚M-^@M-^Ys an old widow, but$
+Brown never told me much about her. He got instructions from her while$
+he was in Paris, but I never discovered how. I went to Madeira with him$
+because he knew I was tough‚M-^@M-^Tbut I wasn‚M-^@M-^Yt tough enough,‚M-^@M-^] he added with a$
+dry smile.$
+$
+Timothy held out his hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ginger,‚M-^@M-^] he said solemnly, ‚M-^@M-^\please forgive the orange!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mind that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\that‚M-^@M-^Ys all in the day‚M-^@M-^Ys work.$
+It made me a bit wild, and my eye‚M-^@M-^Ys feeling sore, but don‚M-^@M-^Yt let that$
+worry you. What you‚M-^@M-^Yve got to do now is to look out for Brown, because$
+he‚M-^@M-^Yll have you as sure as death.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll look out for Madame Serpilot, too,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\I think I‚M-^@M-^Yll go$
+to Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She‚M-^@M-^Ys not in Paris now, I can tell you that,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\The wire$
+Brown got at Liverpool was from Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\is even more attractive than Paris.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                             CHAPTER XVIII$
+$
+$
+CHELWYN left Timothy with something to think about. Who was Madame$
+Serpilot, this old lady who had such an interest in Mary travelling$
+alone? And why, oh! why had she left Paris for Monte Carlo at the fag$
+end of the season? For he and Mary had privately decided between them$
+that London and Paris should only be stopping places on the route to the$
+Riviera. Why should Madame Serpilot have changed her plans at the same$
+time? There was something more than a coincidence in this. At lunch-time$
+he had Mary to herself, her chaperon having a headache.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\can you tell me why we changed our plans on the boat$
+and decided to go straight on to Monte Carlo instead of staying in$
+Paris?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said readily. ‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you remember my telling you about those$
+beautiful books of views that I saw on the ship?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where did you see them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I found them in my cabin one day. I think the steward must have left$
+them,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\They were most wonderful productions, full of coloured$
+prints and photographs‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt I tell you about them?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I remember,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy slowly. ‚M-^@M-^\Found them in your cabin, eh? Well,$
+nobody left any beautiful or attractive pictures of Monte Carlo in my$
+berth, but I think that won‚M-^@M-^Yt stop me going on to Monte Carlo.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was an opportunity she had been seeking for a week and she seized it.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I want to ask you something, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew told me$
+the other day that they call you ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y Anderson. Why is that,$
+Timothy?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Because I take a chance, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he smiled. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yve been taking$
+chances all my life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre not a gambler, Timothy, are you?‚M-^@M-^] she asked gravely. ‚M-^@M-^\I know you$
+bet and play cards, but men do that for amusement, and somehow it is all$
+right. But when men start out to make a living, and actually make a$
+living, by games of chance, they somehow belong to another life and$
+another people.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was silent.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre just too good to go that way, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she went on. ‚M-^@M-^\There are$
+lots of chances that a man can take in this world, in matching his$
+brains, his strength and his skill against other men, and when he wins$
+his stake is safe. He doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt lose it the next day or the next month,$
+and he‚M-^@M-^Ys picking winners all the time, Timothy.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+His first inclination was to be nettled. She was wounding the tender$
+skin of his vanity, and he was startled to discover how tender a skin$
+that was. All that she said was true and less than true. She could not$
+guess how far his mind and inclination were from commonplace labour and$
+how very little work came into the calculations of his future. He looked$
+upon a job as a thing not to be held and developed into something$
+better, but as a stopgap between two successful chances. He was almost$
+shocked when this truth came home to him. The girl was nervous, and$
+painfully anxious not to hurt him, and yet well aware that she was$
+rubbing a sore place.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy, for your sake, as well as for mine, for you‚M-^@M-^Yre a friend of$
+mine, I want to be proud of you, to see you past this present phase of$
+life. Mrs. Renfrew speaks of you as a gambler, and says your name, even$
+at your age, is well known as one who would rather bet than buy. That$
+isn‚M-^@M-^Yt true, Timothy, is it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She put her hand on his and looked into his face. He did not meet her$
+eyes.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think that is true, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said steadily. ‚M-^@M-^\How it comes to be$
+true, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt quite know. I suppose I have drifted a little over the$
+line, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym grateful to you for pulling me up. Oh, no, I don‚M-^@M-^Yt regret$
+the past‚M-^@M-^Tit has all been useful‚M-^@M-^Tand I have made good on chances, but I$
+see there are other chances that a man can take than putting his money$
+on the pace of a horse or backing against zero. Maybe, when I get back$
+to London I‚M-^@M-^Yll settle down into a respectable citizen and keep hens or$
+something.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He was speaking seriously, though at first she thought he was being$
+sarcastic.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And you won‚M-^@M-^Yt gamble again?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He hesitated to reply.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly. ‚M-^@M-^\I mean it isn‚M-^@M-^Yt fair of me to ask$
+you. It is almost cruel,‚M-^@M-^] she smiled, ‚M-^@M-^\to let you go to Monte Carlo and$
+ask you not to put money on the tables. But promise me, Timothy, that$
+when I tell you to stop playing, you will stop.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Here‚M-^@M-^Ys my hand on it,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, brightening up already at the$
+prospect of being allowed to gamble at all. ‚M-^@M-^\Hereafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] He raised$
+his hand solemnly. ‚M-^@M-^\By the way,‚M-^@M-^] he asked, ‚M-^@M-^\do you know a lady named$
+Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She shook her head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, I do not,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have never heard the name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have no relations or friends in France?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\None,‚M-^@M-^] she replied immediately.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What made you go to France at all?‚M-^@M-^] he asked. ‚M-^@M-^\When I heard from you,$
+Mary, you talked about taking a holiday in Madeira before setting up$
+house in Bath, and the first thing I knew of your intention to go abroad$
+again was the letter you sent me just before I started for Madeira.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I wanted to go a year ago, after Sir John‚M-^@M-^Ys death,‚M-^@M-^] she said; ‚M-^@M-^\then$
+Mrs. Renfrew couldn‚M-^@M-^Yt take the trip‚M-^@M-^Tone of her younger children had$
+measles.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has that woman children?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in an awed voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Don‚M-^@M-^Yt be absurd. Of course she has children. It was she who decided on$
+making the trip. She writes little articles in the _Bath County$
+Herald_‚M-^@M-^Ta local paper‚M-^@M-^Ton the care of children and all that sort of$
+thing. She‚M-^@M-^Ys not really a journalist, she is literary.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\sometimes they write poetry, sometimes recipes$
+for ice cream‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xtake three cups of flour, a pint of cream in which an$
+egg has been boiled and a pinch of vanilla‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl smiled. Evidently Timothy had hit upon the particular brand of$
+journalism to which Mrs. Renfrew was addicted.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\there was to have been a sort of Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Welfare Meeting in Paris next week‚M-^@M-^Tan International affair‚M-^@M-^Tand when we$
+were in Madeira she received an invitation to attend with a free return$
+ticket‚M-^@M-^Twasn‚M-^@M-^Yt that splendid?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Splendid,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy absently. ‚M-^@M-^\Naturally you thought it was an$
+excellent opportunity to go also.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\And now you have arrived here you find that the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Meeting has been postponed for ten years?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked at him, startled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you know that the meeting had been postponed?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Oh, I guessed it,‚M-^@M-^] he said airily, ‚M-^@M-^\such things have happened before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The truth is,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\nobody knows anything about this$
+meeting, and the letter which Mrs. Renfrew sent to the Mothers‚M-^@M-^Y Welfare$
+Society in Paris was waiting for us when we arrived at the Carlton. It$
+had been returned‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^XAddressee Unknown.‚M-^@M-^Y Mrs. Renfrew had put the Carlton$
+address inside.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Here was ample excuse for speculation of an innocuous kind. Mrs. Renfrew$
+had been approached because it was known by this mysterious somebody$
+that she would take the girl with her, and this sinister somebody had$
+hired two thugs to shepherd her from Madeira and to put Timothy out of$
+action, should he decide to accompany the party to France. The situation$
+was distinctly interesting.$
+$
+Three days later the party crossed the Channel. Timothy had high hopes$
+of adventure, which were fated to be more than fulfilled. They stayed$
+three days in Paris and he had the time of his life. He went to the$
+races at Maisons Lafitte, and came back glowing with a sense of his$
+virtue, for he had not made a bet. He drifted in to the baccara rooms at$
+Enghien, watched tens of thousands of francs change hands, and returned$
+to Paris that night with a halo fitted by Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys own hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I think you‚M-^@M-^Yre really wonderful, Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\You know you are$
+allowed one final flutter.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym saving that up for Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+Since his arrival in Paris he had lost the right to his name, for he was$
+taking no chances. If he went abroad at night he kept to the brilliantly$
+illuminated boulevards or the crowded caf√©s. He kept clear of the$
+crowds‚M-^@M-^Tespecially crowds which formed quickly and for no apparent$
+reason.$
+$
+He was taking no chances because he felt it was not fair upon the$
+particular genius who presided over his destinies that he should$
+squander his luck in a miraculous escape from death or disablement. Only$
+once, when dining at the Scribe, did he think he saw the familiar face$
+of Mr. Brown. With an apology he left the two ladies and made his way$
+with difficulty through the crowded restaurant, only to find that his$
+man had disappeared.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\These caf√©s have as many doors as a trick-scene,‚M-^@M-^] he grumbled when he$
+came back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you see a friend of yours?‚M-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not so much a friend as one who has a financial interest in me,‚M-^@M-^]$
+replied Timothy.$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew had thawed a little under the beneficent influences of$
+Paris. She was busy sending off picture-postcards and had written to$
+Bath her first impression of the French capital to the extent of three$
+columns. She had also written a poem which began: ‚M-^@M-^\Oh, city of light$
+that shines so bright,‚M-^@M-^] and went on rhyming ‚M-^@M-^\vain‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\Seine,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\gay‚M-^@M-^]$
+with ‚M-^@M-^\play,‚M-^@M-^] ‚M-^@M-^\joy‚M-^@M-^] with ‚M-^@M-^\alloy,‚M-^@M-^] through twenty-three stanzas.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I rather pride myself,‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew, ‚M-^@M-^\upon that description of$
+Paris‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^Xthe city of light.‚M-^@M-^Y Don‚M-^@M-^Yt you think it is very original, Mr.$
+Anderson?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It was,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically. ‚M-^@M-^\Parisians have called it the$
+‚M-^@M-^XVille Lumi√®re‚M-^@M-^Y for about two hundred years.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys almost the same, isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it?‚M-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew. ‚M-^@M-^\How clever the$
+French are!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Mrs. Renfrew did not speak French and took a more generous view of the$
+young man when she discovered that he did. It fell to Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys lot to$
+order tickets, arrange cabs, pay bills and act as unofficial courier to$
+the party. He was anxious to be gone from Paris, impatient for the big$
+game to begin. For some reason, he did not anticipate that any harm$
+would come to the girl. This struck him as strange later, but at the$
+moment all his thoughts were centred upon the match between himself and$
+this old French lady who had set herself out to separate him from Mary$
+Maxell.$
+$
+No unpleasant incident‚M-^@M-^Tthe crowded condition of the dining-car$
+excepted‚M-^@M-^Tmarred the journey to Monte Carlo. There was the inevitable$
+night spent in a stuffy sleeping-berth in a car that rocked and swayed$
+to such an extent that Timothy expected it to jump the line, as$
+thousands of other passengers have expected it to do; and they came with$
+the morning to the Valley of the Rhone, a wide, blue, white-flecked$
+stream flowing between gaunt hills, past solitary ch√¢teaux and strange$
+walled towns, which looked as if they had been kept under glass cases$
+for centuries, that the modern world should be reminded of the dangers$
+under which our forefathers lived. So to Marseilles, and a long, hot and$
+slow journey to Nice.$
+$
+To the girl it was a pilgrimage of joy. She would not have missed a$
+single moment of that ride. The blue sea, the white villas with their$
+green jalousies, the banked roses over wall and pergola and the$
+warm-scented breeze, and above all the semi-tropical sun, placed her in$
+a new world, a wonder world more beautiful than imagination had painted.$
+$
+There is something about Monte Carlo which is very satisfying. It is so$
+orderly, so clean, so white and bright, that you have the impression$
+that it is carefully dusted every morning and that the villas on the$
+hills are taken down weekly by tender hands, polished and replaced.$
+$
+There is nothing garish about Monte Carlo, for all its stucco and$
+plaster. Some of the buildings, and particularly the Casino, were$
+compared by the irreverent Timothy to the White City, but it was a$
+refined White City and the Casino itself, with its glass-roofed porch,$
+its great, solemn hanging lamps and its decorous uniformed attendants,$
+had something of the air of a National Bank.$
+$
+Timothy took a room at the H√¥tel de Paris, where the girl was staying,$
+and lost no time in seeking information.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge. ‚M-^@M-^\There is a madame who bears that$
+name, I think, but she is not staying here, monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of whom should I inquire, I pray you?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy in the vernacular.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Of the Municipal Council, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the concierge, ‚M-^@M-^\or, if the$
+madame is a wealthy madame, of the manager of the Credit Lyonnais, who$
+will perhaps inform monsieur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thanks many times,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+He went first to the Credit Lyonnais, and found the manager extremely$
+polite but uncommunicative. It was not the practice of the bank, he$
+said, to disclose the addresses of their clients. He would not say that$
+Madame Serpilot was his client, but if she were, he could certainly not$
+give her address to any unauthorised person. From this Timothy gathered$
+that Madame Serpilot was a client. He went on to the Mairie and met with$
+better fortune. The Mairie had no respect for persons. It was there to$
+supply information and what the Mairie of Monte Carlo does not know$
+about Monaco, the cleverest detective force in the world would be$
+wasting its time trying to discover.$
+$
+Madame Serpilot lived at the Villa Condamine. The Villa Condamine was$
+not, as the name suggested, in the poorer part of Monte Carlo but in$
+that most exclusive territory, the tiny peninsula of Cap Martin.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Has madam been a resident long?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For one hundred and twenty-nine days,‚M-^@M-^] replied the official promptly.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame hired the villa furnished from the agent, of the Grand Duchess$
+Eleana who, alas! was destroyed in that terrible revolution.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He gave Timothy some details of the family from which the Grand Duchess$
+had sprung, the amount of her income in pre-war days, and was passing to$
+her eccentricities when Timothy took his departure. He was not$
+interested in the Grand Duchess Eleana, alive or dead.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XIX$
+$
+$
+HE went to the house agent on the main street and from him procured$
+the exact position of Madame Serpilot‚M-^@M-^Ys residence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\An old madame?‚M-^@M-^] said the agent. ‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur, I cannot say that she is$
+old. And I cannot say that she is young.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He thought a moment, as though endeavouring to find some reason for this$
+reticence on the subject of her age, and then added:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have not seen her. Madame is a widow,‚M-^@M-^] he went on. ‚M-^@M-^\Alas! there are$
+so many in France as the result of the terrible war.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Then she is young,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\They didn‚M-^@M-^Yt send old men to the$
+front.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\She may be young,‚M-^@M-^] replied the agent, ‚M-^@M-^\or she may be old. One does not$
+know.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the assistant who had shown the lady the house and had taken$
+the documents for her to sign. The assistant was aged sixteen, and at$
+the age of sixteen most people above twenty are listed amongst the aged.$
+He was certain she was a widow and very feeble, because she walked with$
+a stick. She always wore a heavy black veil, even when she was in the$
+garden.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Is it not natural,‚M-^@M-^] said the house agent romantically, ‚M-^@M-^\that the madame$
+who has lost all that makes life worth living should no longer desire$
+the world to look upon her face?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It may be natural in Monte Carlo,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\but it is not natural$
+in London.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He located the house on a large plan which the obliging agent produced,$
+and went back to the hotel, firmly resolved to take the first$
+opportunity of calling on Madame Serpilot and discovering what object$
+she had in view when she arranged to endanger his young life.$
+$
+Mary was waiting for him, a little impatiently for one who had such a$
+horror of gambling.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\We have to get tickets at the Bureau,‚M-^@M-^] she said, ‚M-^@M-^\and the concierge$
+says we must have special membership cards for the Cercle Priv√©e.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The tickets were easy to procure, and they passed into the great saloon$
+where, around five tables, stood silent ovals of humanity. The scene was$
+a weird one to Timothy and fascinating too. Besides this, all the other$
+gambling games in the world, all the roulette tables and baccara$
+outfits, were crude and amateurish. The eight croupiers who sat at each$
+table in their black frock coats and their black ties, solemn visaged,$
+unemotional, might have been deacons in committee. The click of rakes$
+against chips, the whirr of the twirling ball, the monotonous sing-song$
+announcement of the chief croupier‚M-^@M-^Tit was a ritual and a business at$
+one and the same time.$
+$
+It was amazing to reflect that, year in and year out, from ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock$
+in the morning until ten o‚M-^@M-^Yclock at night (until midnight in the Cercle$
+Priv√©e) these black-coated men sat at their tables, twirling their$
+rakes, watching without error every note or counter that fell on the$
+table, separating notes from chips with a deftness that was amazing,$
+doing this in such an atmosphere of respectability that the most rabid$
+anti-gambler watching the scene must come in time to believe that$
+roulette was a legitimate business exercise.$
+$
+Through the years this fringe of people about the table would remain,$
+though units would go out, and as units went out new units would replace$
+them, and everlastingly would sit shabby old men and women with their$
+cryptic notebooks, making their tableaux with red and black pencils,$
+religiously recording the result of every coup, staking now and again$
+their five-franc pieces, and watching them raked to the croupier with$
+stony despair or drawing with trembling hands the few poor francs which$
+fortune had sent them.$
+$
+Timothy was very silent when they passed the portals of the Cercle$
+Priv√©e, into that wonderful interior which, viewed from the entrance$
+room, had the appearance of some rich cathedral.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What do you think of them?‚M-^@M-^] asked Mary.$
+$
+He did not answer at once.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did you think of the people?‚M-^@M-^] she demanded again. ‚M-^@M-^\Did you see$
+that quaint old woman‚M-^@M-^Ttaking a chance? I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry,‚M-^@M-^] she said quickly, ‚M-^@M-^\I$
+really didn‚M-^@M-^Yt mean to be‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you didn‚M-^@M-^Yt,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and sighed.$
+$
+The roulette table did not attract him. He strolled off to watch the$
+players at _trente et quarante_. Here the procedure was more$
+complicated. One of the officials dealt two lines of cards, ending each$
+when the pips added to something over thirty. The top line stood for$
+black, the lower line for red, and that which was nearest to thirty won.$
+After mastering this, the process was simple; you could either back the$
+red or the black, or you could bet that the first card that was dealt$
+was identical with the colour that won, or was the reverse.$
+$
+The game interested him. It had certain features which in a way were$
+fascinating. He noticed that the croupier never spoke of the black. The$
+black might have had no existence at the _trente et quarante_ table;$
+either ‚M-^@M-^\red won‚M-^@M-^] or ‚M-^@M-^\red lost.‚M-^@M-^] He staked a louis and won twice. He$
+staked another and lost it. Then he won three coups of a louis and$
+looked around uncertainly, almost guiltily, for Mary.$
+$
+She was watching the roulette players, and Timothy took a wad of bills$
+from his pocket and counted out six milles. That was another thing he$
+was to discover: there were three classes of players‚M-^@M-^Tthose who punted$
+in one or five louis pieces, those who bet handsomely in milles (a$
+thousand-franc note is a ‚M-^@M-^\mille‚M-^@M-^] and has no other name), and those who$
+went the maximum of twelve thousand francs on each coup.$
+$
+Money had no value. He threw six thousand down to the croupier and$
+received in exchange six oblong plaques like thin cakes of blue soap. He$
+put a thousand francs on the black and lost it. He looked round$
+apprehensively for Mary, but she was still intent upon the roulette$
+players. He ventured another thousand, and lost that too. A young$
+Englishman sitting at the table looked up with a smile.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yre betting against the tableau,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\The table is running red$
+to-night. Look!‚M-^@M-^] He showed a little notebook ruled into divisions, and$
+long lines of dots, one under the other. ‚M-^@M-^\You see,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\all these$
+are reds. The table has only swung across to black twice for any run,$
+and then it was only a run of four. If you bet against the table you‚M-^@M-^Yll$
+go broke.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+At any other place than at the tables at Monte Carlo advice of this$
+character, and intimate references to financial possibilities, would be$
+resented. But the Rooms, like the grave, level all the players, who are$
+a great family banded together in an unrecognised brotherhood for the$
+destruction of a common enemy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Yll take a chance against the table,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\and I shall go$
+broke, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The Englishman laughed.$
+$
+The four thousand francs he had left went the same way as their friends$
+and Timothy changed another six thousand and threw two on the black.$
+Then, acting on the impulse of the moment, he threw down the remaining$
+four.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He turned at the shocked voice and Mary was standing behind him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you gamble like that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He tried to smile, but produced a grimace.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Why, it is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\it is only francs, and francs aren‚M-^@M-^Yt$
+real money, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She turned and walked away and he followed. The Englishman, twisting$
+round in his chair, said something. Timothy thought he was asking$
+whether he should look after his money and answered ‚M-^@M-^\Certainly.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The girl walked to one of the padded benches by the wall and sat down.$
+There was such real trouble in her face that Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys heart sank.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is my last fling and you told me I$
+could have it. After to-night I cut out everything that doesn‚M-^@M-^Yt qualify$
+for the ‚M-^@M-^Xearned income‚M-^@M-^Y column of the tax-surveyor.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You frighten me,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\It isn‚M-^@M-^Yt the amount of money you were$
+venturing, but there was something in your face which made me feel‚M-^@M-^Twhy!$
+I just felt sick,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Mary!‚M-^@M-^] he said in surprise.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know I‚M-^@M-^Ym being unreasonable,‚M-^@M-^] she interrupted, ‚M-^@M-^\but Timothy, I‚M-^@M-^TI$
+just don‚M-^@M-^Yt want to think of you like this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She looked into his dejected face and the softest light that ever shone$
+in woman‚M-^@M-^Ys eyes was in hers.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said, half in jest, ‚M-^@M-^\you‚M-^@M-^Yre paying the penalty for$
+having a girl friend.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym paying the penalty for being a loafer,‚M-^@M-^] he said huskily. ‚M-^@M-^\I think$
+there must be some bad blood in us. Mary, I know what I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing,‚M-^@M-^] he$
+said, and took one of her hands. ‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym losing the right to love you,$
+dearest.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a queer place for such a confession, and in her wildest dreams$
+the girl never imagined that the first word of love spoken to her by any$
+man would come in a gambling saloon at Monte Carlo. Above her where she$
+sat was the great canvas of the Florentine Graces; half nude reliefs on$
+the ceiling dangled glittering chains of light and over all sounded the$
+monotonous voice of the croupier:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tet couleur.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The young Englishman at the table turned round with an inquiring lift of$
+his eyebrows, and Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He wants to know if I‚M-^@M-^Ym finished, I suppose,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and honestly$
+Mary, I am. I‚M-^@M-^Ym going back to London when this trip‚M-^@M-^Ys over, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym$
+going to start at the bottom and work up.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!‚M-^@M-^] she said again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not going to lie to you, or pretend any longer. I just love you,$
+Mary, and if you‚M-^@M-^Yll wait for me, I‚M-^@M-^Yll make good. I have been a gambler,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, ‚M-^@M-^\a poor, low gambler, and all the time I‚M-^@M-^Yve thought I‚M-^@M-^Yve been$
+clever! I‚M-^@M-^Yve been going round puffed up with my own self-importance, and$
+my head‚M-^@M-^Ys been so much in the air that I haven‚M-^@M-^Yt seen just where my feet$
+were leading me,‚M-^@M-^] he laughed. ‚M-^@M-^\This sounds like the sort of thing you$
+get at the Salvation Army penitent form,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\but I‚M-^@M-^Ym straight and$
+sincere.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I know you are, Timothy, but you needn‚M-^@M-^Yt start at the bottom. I have my$
+money‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Stop where you are, Mary,‚M-^@M-^] he said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\Not a penny would I take$
+from you, darling.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did they ring that bell for?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+It was the second time the tinkle of sound had come from the croupier at$
+the _trente et quarante_ table.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Heaven knows!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe it is to call the other$
+worshippers.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the young Englishman looked round and said something.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What did he say?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He said seventeen,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Was that the number you backed?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy smiled.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\There are no numbers on that table except No. 1‚M-^@M-^Tand No. 1 is the fat$
+man with the rake‚M-^@M-^The gets it coming and going. Mary, I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to ask$
+you one question: If I make good will you marry me?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was silent and again the voice of the croupier came:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Rouge perd‚M-^@M-^Tcouleur gagne.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What does ‚M-^@M-^Xrouge perd‚M-^@M-^Y mean?‚M-^@M-^] she asked. ‚M-^@M-^\He has said that ever so many$
+times.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It means ‚M-^@M-^Xblack wins,‚M-^@M-^Y‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does black always win?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not always,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy gently. ‚M-^@M-^\Maybe he‚M-^@M-^Ys only saying that to lure$
+me back to the table. Mary, what do you say?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I say yes,‚M-^@M-^] she said, and to the scandal of the one attendant who was$
+watching them he bent forward and kissed her.$
+$
+A terrible act this, for the gold-laced and liveried footman, who came$
+with slow, majestic steps to where they sat.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\this is not done.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked up at him.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\_Chassez-vous_,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly.$
+$
+It was startling French, but it was the nearest he could get at the$
+moment to ‚M-^@M-^\chase yourself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Again the bell tinkled, and the young Englishman rose, thrust a small$
+packet of money into his pocket and came toward them, bearing what$
+looked to be a large book without covers. His face was a little haggard$
+and the perspiration stood upon his forehead.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\This is getting on my nerves, old man. You had better play yourself,‚M-^@M-^]$
+he said, and he handed the book to Timothy, and Timothy looked vaguely$
+from his hands to the hot Englishman.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What‚M-^@M-^Ys this?‚M-^@M-^] he croaked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\A run of twenty-eight on the black,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\It is$
+phenomenal! You wanted me to go on, didn‚M-^@M-^Yt you? I asked you whether I$
+should play your thousand francs. The bank bust four times‚M-^@M-^Tdidn‚M-^@M-^Yt you$
+hear them ring for more money?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded. He had no words.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, your six went to twelve and I left the maximum run,‚M-^@M-^] the$
+Englishman said. ‚M-^@M-^\I asked you if that was right and you nodded.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I nodded,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy mechanically.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yve won twenty-seven and a half maximums.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy looked at the money in his hand, looked up at the ceiling and$
+gulped something down.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you,‚M-^@M-^] he gasped. ‚M-^@M-^\I am obliged to you.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was inadequate, but it was all that he could say.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Not at all,‚M-^@M-^] said the Englishman. ‚M-^@M-^\I won a lot of money myself.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym not a great hand at arithmetic,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\will you tell me$
+how many pounds twenty-seven and a half maximums make?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was a remarkable situation. Somebody should have laughed, but they$
+were all too serious, the girl as serious as Timothy, and the young$
+Englishman scrawling calculations on a loose page of his notebook.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thirty-five francs to a pound,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\makes ¬£340 a coup.$
+Twenty-seven and a half is about‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, and he gripped the other‚M-^@M-^Ys hand and wrung it.$
+‚M-^@M-^\Thank you, fairy godmother‚M-^@M-^TI don‚M-^@M-^Yt know your other name.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+They stood together watching his lanky figure, as he, wholly unconscious$
+of the providential part he had played, moved down to the roulette$
+table, eyeing the game with the air of superiority which every player of$
+_trente et quarante_ has for a game with a paltry maximum of six$
+thousand francs.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] whispered the girl, ‚M-^@M-^\isn‚M-^@M-^Yt it wonderful?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He put the money into his pocket and it bulged untidily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to do with it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Give it to the poor,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, taking her arm.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To the poor?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was wondering whether his fortune had driven him mad.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The poor,‚M-^@M-^] he said firmly, ‚M-^@M-^\money won by gambling‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense,‚M-^@M-^] she broke in, ‚M-^@M-^\to what poor are you giving it?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\To poor Timothy,‚M-^@M-^] said he. ‚M-^@M-^\Let us dash madly to the bar and drink$
+orangeade.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                               CHAPTER XX$
+$
+$
+THE band was playing one of de Courville‚M-^@M-^Ys new revue tunes, and the$
+Caf√© de Paris was crowded out. There had been a big influx of visitors$
+from Nice, and Monte Carlo presented an appearance comparable with the$
+height of the season. Mrs. Renfrew had motored up to La Turbie, and a$
+bank of cloud having descended upon the mountain made the road$
+dangerous. (Those who have journeyed from the Corniche to Monte Carlo by$
+night will appreciate just how dangerous is that road.) She had,$
+therefore, elected to spend the night at the hotel on the top of the$
+hill.$
+$
+This information she had telephoned to the girl on the night following$
+Timothy‚M-^@M-^Ys great win, and had added that she could see ‚M-^@M-^\the twinkling$
+lights of Monte Carlo‚M-^@M-^] and that ‚M-^@M-^\the misty spaces of ocean filled her$
+with strange unrest,‚M-^@M-^] which observation had been repeated to the$
+unsympathetic Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It must be awful to have a mind like that,‚M-^@M-^] he said, and then, ‚M-^@M-^\Mary,$
+I‚M-^@M-^Yve been a long time waiting to exchange confidences about cousins.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have no confidences to give you about Mrs. Renfrew,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary with a$
+smile, ‚M-^@M-^\but you have been on the point of telling me about your cousin$
+so often that I feel a little curious.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The story he had to tell was not a nice one. It meant opening old wounds$
+and reviving sad memories, but it had to be done. She was not so shocked$
+as he had expected.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You have not told me anything new,‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly. ‚M-^@M-^\You see, all$
+along I have known that the ‚M-^@M-^XA.C.‚M-^@M-^Y in your name stood for ‚M-^@M-^XAlfred$
+Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^Y and once uncle told me that he had known a relative of$
+yours, and I guessed.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Suddenly she demanded:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Do you think Cartwright is in Europe?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I am certain. That is, if Morocco is in Europe,‚M-^@M-^] he said. ‚M-^@M-^\I have had$
+it in the back of my mind ever since the crime was committed that that$
+is the place he would make for. You see, in the few minutes I had with$
+him he told me, perhaps not the whole of the story, but at any rate his$
+version. He knows Morocco and has been there before. He spoke about a$
+Moorish chief named El Mograb, who wanted him to stay with the tribe,$
+and he told me he was sorry he had not followed the Moor‚M-^@M-^Ys advice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Did you tell the police that?‚M-^@M-^] she asked.$
+$
+He shook his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I did not tell the police very much about that visit. Cartwright$
+revived his accusations against Sir John. It meant digging up these$
+charges, and that is what I did not wish to do, for‚M-^@M-^Tfor‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\For my sake?‚M-^@M-^] she said quietly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\That‚M-^@M-^Ys about the size of it,‚M-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
+$
+A little stream of diners were leaving the restaurant, moving slowly$
+down the narrow aisle between the tables, and Timothy stopped talking as$
+they passed and eyed them with a bored interest usual to the$
+circumstances.$
+$
+It was after the interruption had ended, and the last of the little$
+stream had departed, that he saw the card on the table. It was near his$
+place and it had not been there before. He picked it up and on the$
+uppermost side was written: ‚M-^@M-^\Do not let your friend see this.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Well, I‚M-^@M-^Ym‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^] he began, and turned the card over.$
+$
+It was not written but printed in capital letters:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM ME BY THE TWENTY-NINTH, I BEG OF YOU$
+    THAT YOU WILL GO TO TANGIER AND ENQUIRE AT THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL$
+    FOR A MAN CALLED RAHBAT‚M-^@M-^TA MOOR, WHO WILL LEAD YOU TO ME. I BEG$
+    YOU FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO COME. DID YOU GET THE$
+    MONEY?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy laid the card down and stared at the girl.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\What is it?‚M-^@M-^] she asked and reached out her hand.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Tit is nothing,‚M-^@M-^] he said hurriedly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Nonsense, Timothy. What is it? Let me see it, please.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Without a word he handed the card to the girl, who read it through in$
+silence.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who is that from?‚M-^@M-^] she asked, ‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He nodded.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Obviously,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\the reference to the money and the appeal to our$
+relationship‚M-^@M-^Tbut how did it get there?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He called the head waiter.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Who were those people who went out just now?‚M-^@M-^] he asked.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\They are very well known,‚M-^@M-^] explained the head waiter. ‚M-^@M-^\There was a$
+monsieur, a London theatrical manager, and a madame who was his wife.$
+There was another monsieur, an American writer, and an English monsieur$
+who was in the employment as secretary to a madame who lives at Cap$
+Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes, that is the name. She is a widow, _h√©las_! but immensely rich!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy put the card into his pocket. He had said nothing to the girl$
+about Madame Serpilot since they had left London, and for the first time$
+he had some misgivings as to her safety. Yet in truth that sixth sense$
+of his, which had hitherto worked so to his advantage, offered him no$
+warning that the girl‚M-^@M-^Ys happiness was threatened. He was sure that$
+whatever danger the situation held was danger to him personally. He had$
+not seen the English monsieur who was secretary to Madame Serpilot, but$
+then his back had been toward the far end of the room from whence the$
+man came and he had presented no other view than the back of his head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is a message from Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I am going to get to$
+the bottom of this story if I stay in Monte Carlo for the rest of my$
+life.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He saw Mary back to her hotel, went to his room and changed, and just as$
+the Casino was disgorging its tired clients, he walked through the$
+palm-shaded avenue that led to the main road and began his tramp to Cap$
+Martin. To discover a house in this area by daylight, with the aid of a$
+plan, might have been a simple matter‚M-^@M-^Tby night it presented almost$
+insuperable difficulties.$
+$
+Cap Martin is a promontory of hill and pine and wild flower. Its roads$
+run at the will of its wealthy residents, and there are lanes and paths$
+and broad roads which are not really broad roads at all, but the private$
+entrances to the wonderful villas in which the district abounds, and the$
+grey light was in the eastern sky when Timothy finally located the Villa$
+Condamine.$
+$
+It stood on the edge of the sea, surrounded on the land side by a high$
+wall, though if its owner sought seclusion the woods which surrounded$
+the villa were sufficient.$
+$
+Timothy worked round a little bay until he commanded a view of the place$
+from the sea. A zig-zag path led down from the house to the seashore,$
+terminating in a little concrete quay. Presently he heard the sound of$
+footsteps and a Monogasque workman, in blue overalls, came slouching$
+along the shore path, pipe in mouth.$
+$
+He bade the young man a cheery good morning and stopped, in the friendly$
+way of the Monogasques, to talk. He was a gardener on his way to the$
+villa. He could be on his way to nowhere else, for the rough path on$
+which Timothy stood led straight to a door in the high wall. It was a$
+good job, but he wished he lived nearer. But then, none of madame‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+servants slept in the house, and‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Ah! _voil√†!_ It is the Moor!‚M-^@M-^] and he pointed out to sea.$
+$
+A tiny steam yacht was coming slowly to land‚M-^@M-^TTimothy had seen its$
+lights for an hour‚M-^@M-^Tand was steaming now to its anchorage, leaving the$
+line of its wake on the smooth surface of the water.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\The Moor!‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy quickly, and then carelessly, ‚M-^@M-^\Has any Moor a$
+villa here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, monsieur,‚M-^@M-^] said the man, ‚M-^@M-^\but this is a great Moor who sometimes$
+comes here from Morocco. A long journey, monsieur. It is five days‚M-^@M-^Y$
+voyage from the Moorish coast‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Does he come to the Villa Condamine?‚M-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\But yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the man. ‚M-^@M-^\He is a friend of the madame, and twice has he$
+been there in three months.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+There was a little splash of water under the bow of the yacht, when the$
+anchor was dropped, and presently a boat drew away and in the stern$
+sheets was a figure muffled in a white jellab.$
+$
+Timothy looked after the retreating figure of the gardener, who was$
+leisurely pursuing his way, and, turning, followed him. It was unlikely$
+that the mysterious madame would allow a humble workman to have the key$
+of the garden gate, yet to his surprise this was the case. The man$
+opened the gate and waited, looking round as if he expected somebody.$
+Timothy guessed that there were two or more workmen and that this$
+particular man had the key and admitted the lot. In this surmise he$
+proved to be right. Presently yet another blue-bloused gardener$
+appeared, and the two stood together waiting for a third. He made no$
+appearance, and the two men passed through the door and pulled it close$
+behind them.$
+$
+Timothy quickened his pace. As he had thought, the door was left ajar$
+for the third man. He pushed it open gently, but saw nothing but the end$
+of a twisting path, which disappeared between high hedges of lilac.$
+$
+If ever there was a time to take a chance it was now; and he was through$
+the gate, gingerly treading the path, before he realised what he had$
+done. He heard voices and moved with caution. Then, after about five$
+minutes, he heard the garden gate behind him bang. The third workman had$
+arrived and the exit was closed. He made his way through the pines which$
+served to screen the house from observation. There was nobody in sight,$
+and the voices had died away. He could walk more boldly now and came at$
+last to the edge of the wood in full view of the villa. Between him and$
+the house was about fifty yards of clear space. He took a chance and$
+crossed it, his objective being a ground-floor window which was open.$
+$
+The entrance was not so easily effected as he had expected. The sill of$
+the window was just above the level of his head, and offered no grip to$
+his hands. He made a tour of reconnaissance, but failed to find any$
+other entrance. Behind the sill, he thought, must be a window frame, and$
+stepping back two paces he made a leap and gripped the frame. Quickly he$
+pulled himself up and dropped into the room.$
+$
+He was conscious of a sweet, fragrant perfume the moment his head became$
+level with the window, and now he saw the explanation. The bare floor$
+was covered three inches thick with rose petals. Evidently the owner$
+made her own perfumery, and this hobby explained the open window. There$
+was no furniture in the room, which was apparently given up to the$
+purpose of drying the petals. The door was unfastened, and he passed$
+into a stone corridor. The structure of the house puzzled him. He did$
+not expect to find himself in the basement; then he remembered that the$
+villa was built on sloping ground, and that the main entrance must be on$
+a higher floor.$
+$
+A flight of stone steps led to the upper level, and he went up$
+cautiously, a step at a time, and found his exit barred by a door which$
+was fastened on the other side with padlock and staple. It was a$
+primitive method of locking up a cellar, and Timothy, remembering that$
+he had passed a recess filled with garden tools, went back to find the$
+means to remove this obstruction. A long chisel prised the staples from$
+the door with ridiculous ease.$
+$
+He heard voices speaking in low, guarded tones and moved along the$
+carpeted hall on tiptoe. He listened at the door of the room from which$
+the voices proceeded, and was in two minds as to what his next step$
+should be. The door was one of two let in the same wall. He stopped and$
+brought his ear to the keyhole of the second and there was no sound.$
+Turning the handle, he looked in.$
+$
+As he expected, it was separated from the other room by a pair of$
+folding doors which were closed. The voices were more distinct but still$
+indistinguishable. He was now in a small drawing-room, well but not$
+luxuriously furnished. Tall French windows led to a loggia, and, what$
+was more important, on either side of these hung long velvet curtains,$
+which might serve, in case of necessity, as a place of concealment.$
+$
+He heard the door of the next room open, and the voices proceeded along$
+the passage. Then the handle of his own door turned. He had just time to$
+slip behind the curtains before somebody entered. It was a woman, and at$
+the sound of her voice he nearly jumped. She was speaking to somebody in$
+the passage.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He has gone to his room,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\Have your breakfast. He will want$
+you to go into Monte Carlo this morning.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\By daylight?‚M-^@M-^] said the person to whom she spoke, and again Timothy$
+recognised the voice.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\He would not know you with those spectacles. Besides, you had a$
+moustache when you saw him before.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man in the passage mumbled something, and Timothy heard the door of$
+the room close. There was a desk, he had noticed, against the blank wall$
+of the room, and it was to this she made her way. He heard the$
+scratching of her pen on paper, then he walked from his place of$
+concealment. Her back was to him and she did not hear him until his$
+shadow fell across the table. Then, with a little cry, she leapt up.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Good morning, Lady Maxell,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+$
+$
+$
+                              CHAPTER XXI$
+$
+$
+SADIE MAXELL was as white as the paper on which she had been writing.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\How did you get in here?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy did not answer. He stepped round so that he was between the$
+woman and the door.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Where is Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Cartwright?‚M-^@M-^] she repeated. ‚M-^@M-^\What do you want to know of him?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Lower your voice, if you please,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply. ‚M-^@M-^\What is$
+Cartwright to you?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She licked her dry lips before she spoke. Then:$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I married Cartwright or Benson in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tyears ago,‚M-^@M-^] she said.$
+$
+Timothy took a step back.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You married Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] he said incredulously. ‚M-^@M-^\That explains why you$
+came away?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+She was looking at him steadily.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\If it wanted any explanation‚M-^@M-^Tyes,‚M-^@M-^] she said. ‚M-^@M-^\What are you going to$
+do?‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I‚M-^@M-^Ym going after the man you have upstairs, the fake Moor, who came into$
+this house half an hour ago, and I‚M-^@M-^Ym going to hand him to justice.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Before he knew what had happened, she gripped him by his coat with both$
+hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You are not going to do anything of the kind, Mr. ‚M-^@M-^XTake A Chance‚M-^@M-^Y$
+Anderson,‚M-^@M-^] she said between her teeth, and her voice trembled with$
+passion. ‚M-^@M-^\I hated him once, but that was before I knew him. I would$
+sooner see you dead as the other man died than that you should bring him$
+more trouble.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Let me go,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, trying to press loose her hands.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\You‚M-^@M-^Yll leave this house and forget that you were ever here. Oh, you$
+fool, you fool!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had wrenched himself clear of her and flung her backward.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\I have a few words to say to your friend,‚M-^@M-^] he said, ‚M-^@M-^\and I think you‚M-^@M-^Yd$
+better stay here whilst I‚M-^@M-^Ym saying them. I hate having family quarrels$
+in public, anyway.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+He had not heard the door open behind him and it was the ‚M-^@M-^\swish‚M-^@M-^] of the$
+loaded cane which warned him. It did not strike him fair on the head, as$
+was intended, but caught him a glancing blow and he fell on his knees,$
+turning his face to his attacker. He knew it was Brown even before the$
+blow fell.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Shall I settle him?‚M-^@M-^] said a voice as the stick went up again.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\No, no!‚M-^@M-^] cried the woman, ‚M-^@M-^\for God‚M-^@M-^Ys sake, no!‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+It was at that moment that Timothy low-tackled his assailant. Brown$
+tried to strike, but he was too late and went crashing to the floor, his$
+head against the wall. He made one effort to rise, and then with a groan$
+collapsed.$
+$
+Timothy rose, shaking himself and rubbing his bruised shoulder. Without$
+a word, and with only a look at the woman, he made for the door and$
+banged it in her face. His head was swimming as he made his way up the$
+stairs, swaying at every step. From the broad landing at the top led$
+three doors, only one of which was closed. He turned the handle and went$
+in.$
+$
+A man was standing by the window, which overlooked the calm expanse of$
+ocean, glittering in the light of the rising sun. From shoulder to heel$
+he was clad in a long white mantle and a dark blue turban encircled his$
+head.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Now, Cartwright,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy, ‚M-^@M-^\you and I will settle accounts.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+The man had not moved at the sound of the voice, but when Timothy had$
+finished he turned.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\My God!‚M-^@M-^] cried Timothy. ‚M-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell.‚M-^@M-^]$

+$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\TIMOTHY,‚M-^@M-^] said Mary, ‚M-^@M-^\I was just thinking about that beautiful house$
+you took me to see at Cap Martin.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Were you, dear?‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy without any show of interest.$
+$
+They were on the cross-Channel boat and Boulogne was astern.$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\Yes,‚M-^@M-^] said the girl. ‚M-^@M-^\Do you know, I had a feeling that you had taken$
+me there to show me to somebody, some friend of yours perhaps. All the$
+time I was walking about the garden I had a sense of being watched. It$
+is not an uncomfortable sensation, but just that overlooked feeling one$
+has sometimes. I love Monte Carlo. Do you think we shall go back there$
+after‚M-^@M-^Tafter‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^T‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+‚M-^@M-^\It is likely,‚M-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
+$
+The girl rose and went forward along the deck to get a view of a passing$
+destroyer. Timothy took a letter from his pocket and read it for about$
+the twentieth time. It was undated and began:$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MY DEAR ANDERSON,‚M-^@M-^TI cannot tell you how grateful I am to you$
+    for your kindness and for the big, generous sympathy you have$
+    shown me. Especially am I glad that you brought Mary so that I$
+    could see her again, for I just hungered for a sight of the$
+    child. Won‚M-^@M-^Yt you please forgive Sadie? She acted without my$
+    knowledge but in my interests, as she thought, in trying to keep$
+    you away from Monte Carlo after she had planned to bring the$
+    girl so that I could see her.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Yes, I killed Cartwright, but I shot him in self-defence. His$
+    body lies at the bottom of a disused well in the garden of my$
+    house. It is perfectly true that I had been associated in$
+    business with him and that I was in his Moorish syndicate and$
+    heavily involved. I was so very deeply involved at one time, and$
+    so near to ruin that, deceived by some statement which had been$
+    made to Sadie‚M-^@M-^Ys fortune, I made her acquaintance and married$
+    her. During the past year I have never ceased to thank God that$
+    I did so, for she had been the most loyal companion and friend$
+    that a man could desire.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\It was I who fired the shot through my own window. I$
+    contemplated flight from Cartwright, and was manufacturing$
+    evidence against him in advance‚M-^@M-^TGod forgive me. Sadie guessed,$
+    and when she watched me drawing from the well the bag containing$
+    proof that Cartwright‚M-^@M-^Ys charge was not wholly false, she knew$
+    the end was near.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I am perfectly happy, and spend most of my time developing my$
+    property in Morocco, under the protection of El Mograb, an old$
+    Moorish friend of mine, and the supreme protection of the$
+    Sultan, who, as the Pretender, received considerable help from$
+    me. I am six months of the year with Sadie, for Sadie either$
+    lives on the Riviera or at Cadiz and is easily reachable in my$
+    hired yacht.$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\I think it best for all concerned, and especially for our dear$
+    Mary, that I remain as dead. Some day the whole story may be$
+    told, but no useful purpose would be served by publishing it$
+    to-day. The card with the message was intended for her, but I am$
+    glad that it fell into your hands. As you guessed, it was I who$
+    flung Mary‚M-^@M-^Ys money into your room‚M-^@M-^TI dared not post it to her$
+    for fear I was betrayed by my writing, and I knew that you were$
+    safe. God bless you both and bring you happiness and prosperity,$
+    to which I hope this property of mine will one day contribute.‚M-^@M-^]$
+$
+Timothy folded the letter and was putting it in his pocket, then changed$
+his mind and took it out. He read it again, then tore it into pieces and$
+flung it over the side of the ship.$
+$
+Then he too went forward to the wife he had married in Paris‚M-^@M-^Tmuch$
+against the wishes of a scandalised Mrs. Renfrew‚M-^@M-^Twho nevertheless$
+termed it ‚M-^@M-^\a pretty romance‚M-^@M-^] in the article she wrote for the _Bath$
+County Herald_.$

+$
+$
+    A Wonder for$
+    Wise Men$
+    By$
+    Wallace B. Nichols$
+$
+    THOUGH an historical romance, this book is much more than$
+    that, for its theme touches present-day ideas in a remarkable$
+    manner, especially as concerns the hideous uselessness of war.$
+    It is set in the reign of Henry VII and deals with the aftermath$
+    of the Wars of the Roses. The principal character becomes one of$
+    the King‚M-^@M-^Ys most trusted instruments in the founding of modern$
+    England, and the story marches to an emotional and uplifting$
+    close. This is an historical novel where the characters are not$
+    puppets of impossible romance, but living human beings as real$
+    as the people about us every day.$

+$
+    SECRET MARKET$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\This is a first novel by one of our younger poets, and it is a$
+    novel which equally plainly shows him to be an artist. The plot$
+    is cleverly developed, and the story ends at once dramatically$
+    and artistically.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The Glasgow Herald._$
+$
+    BRITTLE GLORY$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\Wallace B. Nichols deserves congratulation. He has demonstrated$
+    a capacity for expression, in terms of strength, beauty and$
+    sincerity, through two mediums. It is an uncommon book with an$
+    outstanding quality: it never ceases to be readable.‚M-^@M-^]‚M-^@M-^T_The$
+    Observer._$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Nichols has all the gifts of a great novelist: an unerring sense$

+    Mr. Fortune$
+    Explains$
+    By$
+    H. C. Bailey$
+$
+    ‚M-^@M-^\MR. FORTUNE‚M-^@M-^] has long since established himself as one of the$
+    brightest stars in the galaxy of modern crime detectives. He$
+    works on the friendliest terms with Scotland Yard, but his$
+    methods‚M-^@M-^Tand incidentally his manners‚M-^@M-^Tare peculiarly his own.$
+    Here we have a series of the most widely divergent mysteries$
+    successively solved by a bland, imperturbable middle-aged$
+    gentleman whose sole concern in life appears to be that he shall$
+    not miss his lunch or any other comfort that is due to him. No$
+    one who has read other ‚M-^@M-^\Mr. Fortune‚M-^@M-^] volumes will on any account$
+    miss this, while those who have yet to make the dear man‚M-^@M-^Ys$
+    acquaintance are to be envied for the joy that awaits them.$

+              Mr. Fortune Speaking   My Lady of Orange, etc.$
+$
+‚M-^AM-^B   Mr. H. C. Bailey is not only a master in the realm of historic$
+    romance, but in that of the mystery story as well: in fact, he is$
+    easily one of the best and most logical of all the many writers of$
+    the detective story to-day.$

+    The Subway$
+    Mystery$
+    By$
+    Ben Bolt$
+$
+    ONE would think it impossible for anybody to walk down into$
+    the crowded new Piccadilly Circus Tube Station and there be$
+    swiftly murdered without immediate discovery of the assassin.$
+    But from the slenderest of clues the whole failure of a great$
+    vengeance is discovered, and Mr. Ben Bolt has provided in his$
+    new story a series of situations and adventures that would keep$
+    the sleepiest reader agog for the end.$

+$
+    ADMIRERS of ‚M-^@M-^\Wee Macgreegor‚M-^@M-^] and kindred works will be$
+    interested to see what the talented author makes of a more$
+    ambitious theme. Subtle characterization is here combined with$
+    the thrills of an Armada treasure hunt, complicated by the$
+    misunderstandings and perplexities of three widely divergent$
+    love affairs. The scenes are laid partly in Spain, partly in the$
+    Western Isles, and what with bloodstained daggers, mysterious$
+    scraps of parchment, buried caskets, plotting priests,$
+    mysterious garden-haunting strangers, and speedy motor-boats,$
+    the reader is kept constantly guessing.$

+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of$

+computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It$
+exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations$

+goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will$

+Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure$
+and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future$
+generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see$

+Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg$
+Literary Archive Foundation$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide$
+spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of$
+increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be$
+freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest$
+array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations$
+($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt$
+status with the IRS.$
+$
+The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating$
+charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United$
+States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a$
+considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up$
+with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations$
+where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND$
+DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular$
+state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we$
+have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition$
+against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who$
+approach us with offers to donate.$
+$
+International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make$
+any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from$
+outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.$
+$
+Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation$
+methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other$
+ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To$
+donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate$
+$
+Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.$
+$
+Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project$
+Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be$
+freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and$
+distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of$
+volunteer support.$
+$
+Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed$
+editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in$
+the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not$
+necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper$
+edition.$
+$
+Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search$
+facility: www.gutenberg.org$
+$
+This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,$
+including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
+Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to$
+subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.$
